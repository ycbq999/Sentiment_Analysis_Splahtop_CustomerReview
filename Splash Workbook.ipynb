However, I hate clarifying 2 times that I'm ordering an unsweetened iced tea and receive a disgustingly saccharine sweet tea.

You know the rest of the story...Oh, and the southern style chicken hockey puck was both dry and burnt. This McDonald's receives 1 star because they were able to make a usual shitty dining experience even shittier.\",\n          \"Food:It's a McDonald's. They are all the same food wise, right? I mean they have to be. Mac Snack Wrap those clever bastards.

With a roller backpack full of ideas anxiously waiting to get off the train at Union Station after the long trip from headquarters in Oak Brook, IL. Pockets filled with employee schedules and a neatly folded franchise license. Then it got lost. Lost into the heart of a dismaying darkness along a transient corridor known as Alameda. Its employee of the month dreams fading against the howling winds of reality in LA, but with its golden arches still standing as a beacon for those hungry.Staff:I didn't think McDonald's could possibly produce employees this professionally hardened. No. The staff here have to be contractors. Hired guns. Soldiers of Fortune. Blackwater mercenaries. \\u0152\\u00e6Warriors jaded after years of serving tours in suburbia and south central. They are a high speed low drag group geared up everyday to get our food hot and fast while defending their outpost from the raiding bands of scavengers. \\u0152\\u00e6Send this icy eyed crew into Afghanistan and watch the New York Times' and Amnesty International's front covers fill with pictures of crying children and burning villages. \\u0152\\u00e6...............................................This is the closest MCD's to my place downtown so eff it. Yes, the locals can be annoying as the other reviewers have stated. I am cautious to say that they are harmless because I cannot guarantee that. \\u0152\\u00e6Eating inside was probably one the most colorful experiences and worst mistakes I ever made in my life and I'll leave it at that. \\u0152\\u00e6The drive thru is not so bad. \\u0152\\u00e6At the window the employees will yell at the locals to leave you alone.

I don't think anything special was going on, so uggghhhh.I had just finished moving all of my stuff from a U-haul down the street and was so tired and hot and all I wanted was a McFlurry and a burger. I think that was too much to handle. The McFlurry came out quickly. The burger? Not so much.Their weird coffee machine was busted (I don't understand why people want to eat those sugar drinks), and it was making this huge line. They also had about 40 people behind the counter and 20 of them trying to fix the machine. I lie, but you get the idea. So, I waited and waited and waited and waited for the burger, like 15 minutes. I hate to say stuff, and I could tell they were backed up so I kept thinking it was just getting there (other people were waiting a while, too). I finally did say something, and OH WADDYA KNOW. My burger was just sitting there at the end of the line.These two middle school boys had been waiting on something since before I had got there. I told them just to push up to the front and show them their receipt. They did, and walked out minutes later.OH. And the place is on a east-west axis with no shade.

the ticket then incompletely filled iti had to ask her to check to see if she filled it correctlyshe acted as if she could not be bothered with that so i asked her againshe begrudgingly checked to she did in fact miss something on the ticketso after 22 minutes i finally had my breakfast biscuit platteras i left an woman approached and identified herself as the manager she was dressed as if she had just awoken in an old tshirt and sweat pantsshe said she had heard what happened and said she would take care of itwell why did not she intervene when she saw i was growing annoyed with the

food is this review reflects solely on the poor service i have been to this location countless times over the years they consistently fail on the service end of things the order takers tend to be rude no smiles and a lot of sighs and lip smacking when you talk to them so why go back you ask this store benefits from being the only place to eat in this area the next stop is at least 12 minutes away on the other side of town also i strongly believe in 2nd chances and know that not every business can satisfy everyone 100 of the time i have given them many chances at earning a positive review i could not recommend this location any less if you can wait take a pass there are better mcdonalds stores in griffin ga\n","5   679455658

not crazy about this mcdonalds this is primarily because they are so slow my gosh what exactly is the hold up it is fast food people also this morning i guess the worker thought his mic was off but it was not i now know that he is trying to get as many hours as possible because he needs money bad spread the word anyway this location is on a little access road and you have to go back the way you came because there is no exit from it at the other end it would have helped if there was one so in the end i think i will avoid this location and find another this should be easy as there is no

and that took retraining ask next time at tthe speakeroh it gets betterwe get to next window where einstein is waiting pours the coffees with different creamssugars added which one is which i asked and he smiled and said one has 2 cream 2 sugar and the other has 3 cream 1 sugar didnt maek the cups but at least he made sure we had straws for our coffees hello management where are you\n","8   679455661  never been upset about any fast food drive thru service till i came to this mcdonaldsafter a long trip from california my wife and i went to mcdonalds for a quick bite to eat before our drive back home we pull up to the drive thru but there are a lot of cars waiting to order we were guessing there must be a lot demand for mcdonalds at this late hour so we wait about 5  10 minutes for our turn to order we order the specials they were having at that time 20 pcs chicken nuggets for 5 and asked for a cup of water because we did not want to drink any sodas at that late hour they take our order but tells us they do not serve cups of water there so we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order however we wait for almost another 10 min to finally pay at the first window  then another 5 more min to finally receive our food by far the worst mcdonalds in the world unfriendly and slow\n","9   679455662

needs to be worth it also the fries used to be cold and the cheese on the burger was never melted everything was just lukewarm now my order has been right a few times in a row and my food hot also i

throughout metro atlanta opened their doors to stranded motorists during the jan 2014 snow storm this mcdonalds on camp creek parkway told a group of senior citizens who were on the way home from an outing that they had to leave their restaurant all they cared about was the dollar after they got that they were done with them too bad they could not have made it down the street to wendys or chic

function of that is so that the orders are not messed up when you get to the window but almost everytime the cashier ends up asking me what did i order i inquired about that before and was told that when someone drives off that messes up the orderwell i guess there is no controlling drive off and at least i know my order has been confirmed so it should be right by the time i get to the second windowthis mcdonalds also has a late night drive thru thur  sat it use to be a 24 hour on those days but i do not think it is any longer one of my biggest pet peeves is that the drive thru staff has no smile in their voice when you are ordering food from the luxury of your vehicle you want to think that the person in charge of taking your order is in good spirits but not at this location\n","13

burger not so muchtheir weird coffee machine was busted i do not understand why people want to eat those sugar drinks and it was making this huge line they also had about 40 people behind the counter and 20 of them trying to fix the machine i lie but you get the idea so i waited and waited and waited and waited for the burger like 15 minutes i hate to say stuff and i could tell they were backed up so i kept thinking it was just getting there other people were waiting a while too i finally did say something and oh waddya know my burger was just sitting there at the end of the linethese two middle school boys had been waiting on something since before i had got there i told them just to push up to the front and show them their receipt they did and walked out minutes lateroh and the place

some tantalizing stuffi try not to give too many 1star reviews but this mcdonalds so deserves it i hardly frequent a mcdonalds at all although this is my second mcdonalds review in less than a week but i need to let the peeps in on this one no yelper should go unwarned of course i came to mcdonalds since i have those coupons for their new contraption the mcwrap which when i pronounce very fast and in my scottish accent sounds much like mccrap after my second go round with this thing i have made up my mind it is decidedly so i need to write mcdonalds execs to change the name on this thing immediatelymy coupon for the day was buy a medium fries and a medium drink get a mcwrap of your choice for free i have a hard time resisting free i am here to tell youworst almost free meal of my life seriouslyit was the tail end of lunchtime so the line was still a bit busy i patiently waited for almost 10 minuteswhich is like forever in mcdonalds time at least two folks left the line while i was there i know it is not mcdonalds fault but the couple in front of me took up majority of the line space because they were in motorized wheelchairs and they were very loud this does not bother me much butthey were also very stinky yes stinky i have no problem with stinky in most cases i occasionally help the homeless so i know but the guy in front of me had not washed in days if i were to guess to each his own and i know it is almost summer so i know we all want to save waterbut damn if i get a whiff and i have to take a step back you might be stinky but who am i to judge i took a big step back and waited my turn free is the motivation here i finally get up there to the mcdonalds cashier and present my coupon to the guy he takes a look at it and says we do not usually take the promo coupons at this location but well let you use it then he proceeds to put the coupon onto a stack ofmore coupons mind boggling to say the least he takes my order of a medium fries and medium drink asks me what type of mcwrap i want grilled chicken  bacon and rings me up 291 later i am given my receipt and asked to wait for my number to be calledi wait and wait 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 obviously i am 4 and 10 minutes later i am still waiting honestly what the hell are you guys doing back there mixing the masa for my fresh pressed tortilla feathering a chicken perhaps ripening a tomato i ask the mcdonalds runner and he tells me were waiting for your mcwrap of courseat this point i am almost running late to be back at work so the minute i get my order i bolt back to the office and have lunch at my desk thankfully i am only three minutes away i really really should have just gone to the vending machine or eaten my stash of reeses chocolate peanut butter eggs from last easter talk about thisappointment i take out my mcwrap from my bag and lay down the box of fries on my desk i continue working while munching away on what is supposed to be mcdonalds claim to fame their golden fries i bite into one eh a bit stale i bit into another one eh not enough salt i bite into yet another one eh cold i look down and whaddaya know my damn fry is not even barely cooked white like olivia wilde in the winter i look through the entire box and find at least half a dozen fries not cooked properly not golden brown not delicious barely out of their frozen state and just limp not acceptable please check my pic for proof of this travesty mcdonalds not doing their fries right is like ikea not serving their swethish meatballs with gravy no buenoafter getting over this somewhat i finally hit my stride to go on to my grilled chicken  bacon mcwrap wow talk about lightning striking twice this thing was lifeless after unwrapping this beast the box is still the best part about this mcwrap i could just tell something was off tortilla was already showing signs of being soggy way too long the chicken peeking out of the top was not looking tip top shape either after some hesitation i took a bite ugh i say ugh freshness was not part of the gameplan for this mcdonalds today all cold and soggy and upon all my mcwrap was not built correctly instead of having spring mix like it is supposed to there was plain old shredded iceberg lettuce and my bacon was missing in the words of our lord darth vadernoooooooo it was mccrap through  through totally upset over this one i have picture proof of this travesty of gourmet eats as well mcdonalds you have pissed off the wrong fatty i will definitely be calling your hotline to complain about this one for sure knowing my luck i will get a coupon for a free mcwrap crap\n","Processing review 246/1525\n","Processing review 247/1525\n","Processing review 248/1525\n","Processing review 249/1525\n","Processing review 250/1525\n","Processing review

245/1525: it is 2 for 1 review day i cannot review the walmart without reviewing the mcdonalds that resides inside and boy is it some tantalizing stuffi try not to give too many 1star reviews but this mcdonalds so deserves it i hardly frequent a mcdonalds at all although this is my second mcdonalds review in less than a week but i need to let the peeps in on this one no yelper should go unwarned of course i came to mcdonalds since i have those coupons for their new contraption the mcwrap which when i pronounce very fast and in my scottish accent sounds much like mccrap after my second go round with this thing i have made up my mind it is decidedly so i need to write mcdonalds execs to change the name on this thing immediatelymy coupon for the day was buy a medium fries and a medium drink get a mcwrap of your choice for free i have a hard time resisting free i am here to tell youworst almost free meal of my life seriouslyit was the tail end of lunchtime so the line was still a bit busy i patiently waited for almost 10 minuteswhich is like forever in mcdonalds time at least two folks left the line while i was there i know it is not mcdonalds fault but the couple in front of me took up majority of the line space because they were in motorized wheelchairs and they were very loud this does not bother me much butthey were also very stinky yes stinky i have no problem with stinky in most cases i occasionally help the homeless so i know but the guy in front of me had not washed in days if i were to guess to each his own and i know it is almost summer so i know we all want to save waterbut damn if i get a whiff and i have to take a step back you might be stinky but who am i to judge i took a big step back and waited my turn free is the motivation here i finally get up there to the mcdonalds cashier and present my coupon to the guy he takes a look at it and says we do not usually take the promo coupons at this location but well let you use it then he proceeds to put the coupon onto a stack ofmore coupons mind boggling to say the least he takes my order of a medium fries and medium drink asks me what type of mcwrap i want grilled chicken  bacon and rings me up 291 later i am given my receipt and asked to wait for my number to be calledi wait and wait 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 obviously i am 4 and 10 minutes later i am still waiting honestly what the hell are you guys doing back there mixing the masa for my fresh pressed tortilla feathering a chicken perhaps ripening a tomato i ask the mcdonalds runner and he tells me were waiting for your mcwrap of courseat this point i am almost running late to be back at work so the minute i get my order i bolt back to the office and have lunch at my desk thankfully i am only three minutes away i really really should have just gone to the vending machine or eaten my stash of reeses chocolate peanut butter eggs from last easter talk about thisappointment i take out my mcwrap from my bag and lay down the box of fries on my desk i continue working while munching away on what is supposed to be mcdonalds claim to fame their golden fries i bite into one eh a bit stale i bit into another one eh not enough salt i bite into yet another one eh cold i look down and whaddaya know my damn fry is not even barely cooked white like olivia wilde in the winter i look through the entire box and find at least half a dozen fries not cooked properly not golden brown not delicious barely out of their frozen state and just limp not acceptable please check my pic for proof of this travesty mcdonalds not doing their fries right is like ikea not serving their swethish meatballs with gravy no buenoafter getting over this somewhat i finally hit my stride to go on to my grilled chicken  bacon mcwrap wow talk about lightning striking twice this thing was lifeless after unwrapping this beast the box is still the best part about this mcwrap i could just tell something was off tortilla was already showing signs of being soggy way too long the chicken peeking out of the top was not looking tip top shape either after some hesitation i took a bite ugh i say ugh freshness was not part of the gameplan for this mcdonalds today all cold and soggy and upon all my mcwrap was not built correctly instead of having spring mix like it is supposed to there was plain old shredded iceberg lettuce and my bacon was missing in the words of our lord darth vadernoooooooo it was mccrap through  through totally upset over this one i have picture proof of this travesty of gourmet eats as well mcdonalds you have pissed off the wrong fatty i will definitely be calling your hotline to complain about this one for sure knowing my luck i will get a coupon for a free mcwrap crap\n","Error details: The size of tensor a (1062) must match
