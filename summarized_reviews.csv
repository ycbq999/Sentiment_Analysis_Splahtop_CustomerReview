well it is mcdonalds so you know what the food is this review reflects solely on the poor service i have been to this location countless times over the years they consistently fail on the service end of things the order takers tend to be rude no smiles and a lot of sighs and lip smacking when you talk to them so why go back you ask this store benefits from being the only place to eat in this area the next stop is at least 12 minutes away on the other side of town also i strongly believe in 2nd chances and know that not every business can satisfy everyone 100 of the time i have given them many chances at earning a positive review i could not recommend this location any less if you can wait take a pass there are better mcdonalds stores in griffin ga, This review reflects solely on the poor service . The order takers tend to be rude no smiles and a lot of sighs and lip smacking when you talk to them . The next stop is at least 12 minutes away .

the drive thru makes them lost a star since my last reviewthis is one of those two lane drive thrus and i know that the function of that is so that the orders are not messed up when you get to the window but almost everytime the cashier ends up asking me what did i order i inquired about that before and was told that when someone drives off that messes up the orderwell i guess there is no controlling drive off and at least i know my order has been confirmed so it should be right by the time i get to the second windowthis mcdonalds also has a late night drive thru thur  sat it use to be a 24 hour on those days but i do not think it is any longer one of my biggest pet peeves is that the drive thru staff has no smile in their voice when you are ordering food from the luxury of your vehicle you want to think that the person in charge of taking your order is in good spirits but not at this location, the drive thru makes them lost a star since my last review .

on your way to the airport or just cruising down camp creek pkwy are you absolutely in love with mcdonalds sweet tea well then do not ever go through this drive thru hands down this is the slowest mcdonalds drive thru i have experienced in atlanta considering this location is close to the airport it would be great if they could simply improve the quality of service as a lover of sweet tea i was completely turned off by this location when i overheard the drive thru operator joking about how sweet it was a few years ago she told a few of her associates that it was like syrup and liquid diabetes by the time i took my first and only sip i was on i285 headed to perimeter mall and it tasted like cold syrup thank goodness for the mcdonalds near perimeter mall because they refilled my drink so the moral to the story is if youre on camp creek pkwy near the airport bypass mcdonalds and head for chickfila eatmorechicken, This is the slowest mcdonalds drive thru i have experienced in atlanta considering this location is close to the airport .

ghetto went in yesterday just to get a soda and could not even park in handicap parking spot because their delivery truck was blocking all spaces finally made it inside and it was about 5 customers to one cashier the shift manager made the comment that the car that was waiting needed to be pulled up because they are holding up her line now how is that when they are waiting on their orderhell i was thinking you are holding up the customer and the others waiting anyway finally placed order and was told 107 which i paid exact price here is where its sadthe cashier did not ring up the soda so therefore i did not get a receipt i know that she planned to pocket the money which is sad and bad because eventually that cost will get passed off to customers through price increases i will not return here because i do not like to feel like i am in someones hood and i hate a thief maybe i will call to tell them but then again they probably do not care or maybe even steal themselves plus i do not eat fast food anyway so no need to waste precious minutes, ghetto went in yesterday just to get a soda and could not even park in handicap parking spot because their delivery truck was blocking all spaces .

typical mcdonalds restaurant located at powers ferry and new northside on the north end of the perimeter i have always avoided this location due to the fact that i am not really a fan of mcdonalds in general but the other morning on my way to work i was craving some breakfast and only had time to pull into a drivethru and grab a quick bite to go since mcdonalds is the only place with a drivethru on my way to work i stopped by here to grab their special 2 bacon egg  cheese biscuits for 250 the food was ok just tasted like you would expect mcdonalds food to taste the service was pretty good at the drivethru they were friendly enough but what really gets me is how lazy has america become that the drivethru welcome and what would you like to order has to be automated at mcdonalds, The drivethru is located at powers ferry and new northside on the north end of the perimeter .

on my way to curry honda for my scheduled maintenance appointment i went to the drivethru of this mcdonalds since it was so conveniently located almost adjacent to the honda dealership it was around 145 pm on a saturday afternoon and there were probably only two cars in front of me so i thought i would be in and out of there quickly what i thought would be a quick drivethru took over ten minutes i am not sure what the hold up was but perhaps one or both of the cars in front of me got a large order all i ordered was a spicy mcchicken sandwich small fries and a cup of ice wateragain curry honda is located super close to the mcdonalds so the food should have still been hot or at least warm when i got there however when i sat down to eat my food in the waiting room i noticed the sandwich and fries were barely warm and the ice in my water was almost completely melted i guess the food had been cooked and sitting out for a while and they must keep cups of ice water ready to hand out to customers boo it was my first time trying the spicy mcchicken sandwich and i thought it was decent it has a very slight kick of spice and is at least a little more interesting than the plain ol mcchicken sandwichoverall this mcdonalds gets 3 stars for being ok yes service could have been quicker and the food should have been served hotter but this is a mcdonalds and at least the employees were friendly i may return to this mcdonalds if i am on my way to curry honda and did not have time to grab food elsewhere but it wouldnt be my top choice for fast food in the areareview 324 of 366, The drivethru took over ten minutes for a spicy mcchicken sandwich . The food was barely warm and the ice in my water was almost completely melted . Service could have been quicker and the food should have been served hotter .

customer service is well below par here i placed my order through the intercom and was told that i would have to pay in separate transactions if i were to use more than 1 coupon i expected that and was fine with it up until i got to the window in which one of the girls working the cashier had a problem with me using the coupons and i quote mentioned i do not give a d and a f what she wants i never make it a goal to be difficult to other people and i find it very rude let alone unnecessary that i received this treatment it is part of your jobs duties to simply put in a customers order if you do not like your job you have no business being there and there are plenty of job seekers out there who would be more deserving of your position to top it off after i left the restaurant i opened my bag to find out that i did not receive everything i ordered and paid for, customer service is well below par here i placed my order through the intercom and was told that i would have to pay in separate transactions if i were to use more than 1 coupon .

this mcdonalds is located right next to the building which houses studio movie grill it is super convenient to stop by and grab a quick bite before watching a movie if you do not want to spend a lot of money for food at the theater but that is pretty much where the pros of this location stopi have been to this mcdonalds several times but i have been a bit thisappointed on several occasions most recently i went through the drivethru and got a simple order  a mcchicken sandwich and small fries i drove to the studio movie grill parking lot to eat before a movie and noticed that my fries were cold ughhhhh cold mcdonalds fries are the worst lamethe employees seem to be pretty friendly and the restaurant looks decent inside unfortunately they lack power outlets i saw one but maybe there is a one or two more scattered throughout the restaurant this makes it inconvenient for people who like to stop by mcdonalds to use their laptops which i do quite oftenoverall this mcdonalds deserves about 25 stars because it is right in between meh and aok i know some may say it is just a mcdonalds but hey  i have been to numerous other locations where their food is pretty consistent do not serve cold fries and there are numerous power outlets for customers use i will probably be back just because it is right next to studio movie grill but i am hoping they will start improving the quality of their fast food  at least to the mcdonalds standardreview 076 of 366, this mcdonalds is located right next to the building which houses studio movie grill .

my poor wife stepdaughter and her three johns creek junior lacrosse gladiator teammates who spent the night saturday and were craving mickey ds this morning second week in a row mas been screwed by this franchise store 10131 it is just so close to us and the kids really wanted it yeah yeah  fool me once and i even said now honey be sure to check the bag for everything before you drive away since these same folks screwed us on easter morning en route to churchbut that is tough to do  nearly impossible  with a car full of tweens and on busy holcomb bridge road en route to barnwell with three big bags stuffed with 45 worth of mcds decadence imagine three bags stuffed full of food  all in individual wrappers and some almost too hot to handle but why should we even have to check behind these folks fully expecting our orders have been satisfied you get what you pay for right not at this franchise store at least on this blustery but sunny sunday morning ma got a receipt three sandwiches missing this time totaling 6 last weeks tally was about the same whats worse is you have no recourse because the franchises contact number on the receipt goes straight to fax no really see for yourselves 7709987710 diabolical strategy to be sure were not even fast food fans by any stretch especially after watching morgan spurlocks super size me a few years back blech enwikipediaorgwikisuao_and truth be told if the adjacent chickfila was open on sunday that would be our first choice but it is not and now were left with no choice for sunday morning brekky on the go because were never evurh going back to this mcdonalds hey but do not you know people talk especially here in johns creek all of our adjacent neighborhoods and sports teams have monthly news letters and social media sites highly active i might addso you can bet the balance of our missing orders that whats happened to us will not happen to our friends and neighbors  unless they let it, Three sandwiches missing this time totaling 6 last weeks tally was about the same . The franchises contact number on the receipt goes straight to fax no really see for yourselves 7709987710 diabolical strategy to be sure .
i admit i am not a big fan of mcdonalds however sometimes nothing hits the spot like their fries and a diet coke what pushes this location over the edge of some others is the staff they are always super nice whether it is 10am or 10pm they do not make you repeat your order 18 times and they get it right they are also generous with the condiments when you ask for them and even when you do not unlike some fast food places that stop serving milkshakes after a certain hour because they have already cleaned the machine they will make you a milkshake up until they close service is a huge thing for me so the fact that they are always smiling and ready to help me get my fat fix is what makes me partial to this particular location it can be a bit of a pain to get into and out of as it is right on holcomb bridge rd but that is a minor annoyance, Staff are always super nice whether it is 10am or 10pm they do not make you repeat your order 18 times and they get it right . They are generous with the condiments when you ask for them and even when you do not
only the fact that its a mcdonalds is what earns it a 25 star the staff at this location can vary from customer service focused to blatant thisregard about anything other than accepting your food order and taking your payment my last visit was a combination of the two when i placed my order an the drive thru intercom the order was taken correctly total given thanked and asked to drive around to the window by the time i got around to the window the person that was to take my money and give me my food was way more interested in an argument that was going on outside in the parking lot between two young ladies and the two young men they were withi will admit that i too paid attention to the fight in the parking lot to make sure it did not escalate into gunfire with my car sitting center mass of it all about six months ago someone told me they got robbed while sitting in the drive thru at this location but they were there around 2am and my visit was taking place at 6pm so i was not worried about getting robbed as much as i was about getting shotafter making sure that the parking lot was not about to be shot up he accepted my cash asked me if i wanted to wait a minuite and get some hot fries i did and i didsure i will go back i love mcdonalds fries 18 of 100, Staff at this location can vary from customer service focused to blatant thisregard about anything other than accepting your food order and taking your payment .

of course this is a fast food restaurant so of course there is not much of a spectacular review that i can write but i will express my concerns i work late nights and when i do get off work if there nothing ready in the house i will stop and my only option is mcdonalds or checkers needless to say this is nothing short of ghetto i could hear the employees in the background laughing and playing over the intercom as i am ordering the food after i ordered she did not even bother to tell me my total or go over my order with me when i made it to the window she was having a conversation with her co worker despite me having my hand out the window to give her the money when i drove up to the second windowsomeone had been smoking a cigarette and threw it right outside the drivethrough window now i do not know if it was maybe a previous customer or and employee but nobody was in front of me when i pulled up but hard to say i could hear the music they were playing over my radio in the car and to top it off somebody was calling another chick a btch and just being loud i mean hey did not expect nothing spectacular but if these are the people thats making my big mac i will pass the day shift is the complete opposite so do not be thiscouraged too much by this my food tasted mcdonalds worthy but they need to change up that scenery a bit, of course this is a fast food restaurant so of course there is not much of a spectacular review that i can write but i will express my concerns i work late nights and when i do get off work if there nothing ready in the house

went through the drivethru today at about 1115 am for lunch ordered the habanero quarter pounders and a caramel sundae sundae machine was down so no sundae i should have taken that as an omen and just left got the promo to buy a quarter pounder  get one free when i went to eat my sandwich i had to search for the habanero sauce just a touch was on the bun and the burger was dry as hell and tasted like it had been reheated from the day before i took one bite and could barely chew it i threw them both away what a waste of gas and time never going to this place again  awful, The burger was dry as hell and tasted like it had been reheated from the day before i took one bite and could barely chew it i threw them both away what a waste of gas and time never going to this place again .

do not tell anyone but i like mcdonalds coffee better than starbucks i rather have mcdonalds coffee over any other coffee in the world this mcdonalds location would have gotten 5 stars about 3 months ago but things have changed a few months ago the workers were really cool but now they have all just gotten really fcking weird it is almost like one of those 1980s bhorror movies where one of the workers gets infected with the zombievampirewerewolf virus and then comes to work the next day and spreads it to all his coworkers that is the only logical explanation because every worker here has transformed into mcdumbassesi want to remind you that this is summerlin so that means that everyone runs stop signs no one yields for pedestrians and everyone argues over the stupidest most insignificant things watch out when you are entering this drivethru because there is a huge chance that some douchebag in a bmw will run the stop sign in order to cut in front of youwhen i drove up to the box there was no answer about 2 minutes later i begin hearing a ton of static and then this bizarre sounding guy starts talking in this strange tone he sounded like a drunk orson wells when i pulled up to the first window to pay the window slowly slid open to reveal the face of a morbid looking kid with gigantic dilated eyes and one of those horror movie smiles immediately he lets out this high pitched reeehhhhhhhhhhhhhh noise at me at that particular moment due to the fear of manrape i thought about driving over the planters and escaping but he looked so weird that i came to the conclusion that he might have some kind of paranormal super powers and would catch me no matter how fast i drove so i just sat there and awaited my fate after about 23 seconds he told me how much my coffee cost in a thisturbingly soft tone voice and thankfully he did not serve me mcrape when i drove up to the pickup window i was greeted by an anorexic looking latino kid who did not even give me eye contact and while holding the coffee he sticks his arm out the window and just drops it before i even have the chance to reach out to grab it it was a miracle that i caught the thing in mid air i was glad to get the mcfck out of there, A few months ago the workers were really cool but now they have all just gotten really fcking weird .

years of pathetic service thisgusting food and dangerous mistakes why do i keep going backhaving nothing to do with mcdonalds food in general and more to do with the ability of this specific location to produce it with out killing anybody i have been going to this particular store for years it is right around the corner from where i used to live and is on the way from where i live to pretty much everything i use gas station costco movie theater market etc it is the only convenient location and for a while mcdonalds was the only place that had 1 drinks so those are my lame excuses for repeatedly torturing myself with this horrible place service i used to be a manager with another fast food chain i know what service should be i also know what it usually is it does not have to be 5 star but the rude attitudes ridiculously slow service and inability to get a single order right is really a bit too much when i say slow service i am talking 15 minutes is average drive thru time for a dollar menu burger and a soda correct orders yes my order can occasionally be complicated no castup add big mac sauce but when i thought they could do no worse they messed up an order for 4 large drinks 2 diet cokes a lemonade and an unsweet iced tea all with extra ice we received a regular coke a lemonade a dr pepper and a sweet iced tea 2 drinks had no ice at all and the other 2 had a few pieces floating around we have never received a correct order from this store ever i could go on and on about it but i will stick with this sad example and move ondangerousthisgustingincorrectly made something a little different then an order where they put the wrong thing in the bag or mess up a custom is when they just make it incorrectly or dangerously some of the examples of this include pies that expired an hour before i received them an egg that was completely raw in the middle and tonights lovely mess up tonight i ordered the angus mushroom and swiss according to the website this should include 2 full slices of swiss cheese and a decent amount of mushrooms i had about a teaspoon of mushrooms no sauce and 12 a slice of cheese that is right they left off a slice and a half of cheese in addition it was a regular and relatively old quarter pound patty not the big ole angus patty they should have used i have called the number on the receipt multiple times that takes me to the thistrict office they consistently send out a free sandwich or drink coupon to apologize they tell me how sorry they are and suggest i try one of their other locations as this is the only one they receive complaints from from what i was told they are revamping this store but i have been told that for well over a year and it seems to have been unvamped and going down hill which i did not think was even possible i keep vowing this will be my last visit but then find myself sitting in the drive thru line yet again wondering if i will ever receive my food i highly do not recommend this location hopefully you would not be lured in by whatever the heck keeps luring me sarah this was written by pauls wife because i am usually the one dealing with them i guess he got smarter, After years of pathetic service thisgusting food and dangerous mistakes why do i keep going back . i have been going to this particular store for years it is right around the corner from where i used to live and is on the way from

i usually do not have problems with this location even though i get irritated with their employees attitudes sometimes today however my experience annoyed me more than usual because of the dumb people who work there the one worker that i absolutely dread encountering is the slightly older woman with glasses who is on the heavier side she has the worst attitude out of all the workers there and it is clear that she hates her job she is just not friendly at all and can never get an order right when i drove up to the pick up window a teenage employee was there and gave me my bag of food i ordered two combos i waited about 15 seconds for my drinks and he was awkwardly standing there wondering why i did not drive off yet then he asked are you waiting for something else that should be it i said we ordered drinks too he looks behind him and there are my drinks oh he exclaims as i am situating the drinks into my cup holders i hear him say here when i turn around towards the window half of his arm is in my car and the straws almost hit my face wtf i was so irritated by his incompetency also one thing that i do not like is how two drivethru speakers are built but the employees are always confused by which one to use for example i would order at the first speaker when there is a long line i get stuck at the second speaker and a worker tries to take my order there when i already ordered at the first one sometimes i tell them that i have already ordered and sometimes i ignore them even when they are constantly asking hello are you ready to orderincompetent workers and a confusing drivethru so annoying, i usually do not have problems with this location even though i get irritated with their employees attitudes sometimes today however my experience annoyed me more than usual because of the dumb people who work there .

it is 2 for 1 review day i cannot review the walmart without reviewing the mcdonalds that resides inside and boy is it some tantalizing stuffi try not to give too many 1star reviews but this mcdonalds so deserves it i hardly frequent a mcdonalds at all although this is my second mcdonalds review in less than a week but i need to let the peeps in on this one no yelper should go unwarned of course i came to mcdonalds since i have those coupons for their new contraption the mcwrap which when i pronounce very fast and in my scottish accent sounds much like mccrap after my second go round with this thing i have made up my mind it is decidedly so i need to write mcdonalds execs to change the name on this thing immediatelymy coupon for the day was buy a medium fries and a medium drink get a mcwrap of your choice for free i have a hard time resisting free i am here to tell youworst almost free meal of my life seriouslyit was the tail end of lunchtime so the line was still a bit busy i patiently waited for almost 10 minuteswhich is like forever in mcdonalds time at least two folks left the line while i was there i know it is not mcdonalds fault but the couple in front of me took up majority of the line space because they were in motorized wheelchairs and they were very loud this does not bother me much butthey were also very stinky yes stinky i have no problem with stinky in most cases i occasionally help the homeless so i know but the guy in front of me had not washed in days if i were to guess to each his own and i know it is almost summer so i know we all want to save waterbut damn if i get a whiff and i have to take a step back you might be stinky but who am i to judge i took a big step back and waited my turn free is the motivation here i finally get up there to the mcdonalds cashier and present my coupon to the guy he takes a look at it and says we do not usually take the promo coupons at this location but well let you use it then he proceeds to put the coupon onto a stack ofmore coupons mind boggling to say the least he takes my order of a medium fries and medium drink asks me what type of mcwrap i want grilled chicken  bacon and rings me up 291 later i am given my receipt and asked to wait for my number to be calledi wait and wait 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 obviously i am 4 and 10 minutes later i am still waiting honestly what the hell are you guys doing back there mixing the masa for my fresh pressed tortilla feathering a chicken perhaps ripening a tomato i ask the mcdonalds runner and he tells me were waiting for your mcwrap of courseat this point i am almost running late to be back at work so the minute i get my order i bolt back to the office and have lunch at my desk thankfully i am only three minutes away i really really should have just gone to the vending machine or eaten my stash of reeses chocolate peanut butter eggs from last easter talk about thisappointment i take out my mcwrap from my bag and lay down the box of fries on my desk i continue working while munching away on what is supposed to be mcdonalds claim to fame their golden fries i bite into one eh a bit stale i bit into another one eh not enough salt i bite into yet another one eh cold i look down and whaddaya know my damn fry is not even barely cooked white like olivia wilde in the winter i look through the entire box and find at least half a dozen fries not cooked properly not golden brown not delicious barely out of their frozen state and just limp not acceptable please check my pic for proof of this travesty mcdonalds not doing their fries right is like ikea not serving their swethish meatballs with gravy no buenoafter getting over this somewhat i finally hit my stride to go on to my grilled chicken  bacon mcwrap wow talk about lightning striking twice this thing was lifeless after unwrapping this beast the box is still the best part about this mcwrap i could just tell something was off tortilla was already showing signs of being soggy way too long the chicken peeking out of the top was not looking tip top shape either after some hesitation i took a bite ugh i say ugh freshness was not part of the gameplan for this mcdonalds today all cold and soggy and upon all my mcwrap was not built correctly instead of having spring mix like it is supposed to there was plain old shredded iceberg lettuce and my bacon was missing in the words of our lord darth vadernoooooooo it was mccrap through  through totally upset over this one i have picture proof of this travesty of gourmet eats as well mcdonalds you have pissed off the wrong

i never believed it until now they screw you at the drive thru yep check your bag before you leave the window because they have a tendency more often than not to not give you what you orderedcase in point today at 545am picking up breakfast for the family purchased 4 hash browns 2 sausage burritos 1 parfait 2 large sweet teas and a hotcakes and sausage with extra butter and i asked for the extra butter repeatedly we waited the drive thru for a good 5 minutes because they were making our hash browns fresh so they said i get home and there is no parfait ergh called the restaurant and it seems like them screwing up at the drive thru is common place she took my name down and asked if i wanted to come back this morning or if she should add my name to the book now that one of my kids did not have their breakfast item i continued to go through the bags to find out that there is no extra butter and they did not include the picante sauce packets for the burritos how hard is it for your employees to double check the bags before you give it to the customer i mean you have the receipt that tells you exactly what to put in the bags this is the closest mc donalds to our home and it will soon be put on my banned restaurant list, Check your bag before you leave the window because they have a tendency more often than not to not give you what you ordered . i never believed it until now they screw you at the drive thru .
this is probably the worst night shift mcdonalds evertheir drive through service is horrendous when you approach the drive through you wait i would say at least 5 mins before someone acknowledges you from the speaker menutonight when i went to the first window to pay no one was there the car in front of me already left leaving me to wonder if i needed to pull up to the 2nd window instead i pull up to the 2nd window only to have a staff member lecture me about not paying which by the way i already had my money out ready to pay but because it was an inconvenience for her to walk back to the first window she felt the need to argue first to top things off they had the wrong order so i had to wait again for my order believe it or not it took me about 20 mins for a 10 piece nugget meal i thought its called fast food, This is probably the worst night shift mcdonalds ever . Their drive through service is horrendous when you approach the drive through you wait at least 5 mins before someone acknowledges you from the speaker .

i never thought i would write a review of a mcdonalds much less have to write a negative review for a mcdonalds i do not even know how it is possible that a mcdonalds could be so bad but unfortunately this one is  like many people i have eaten at mcdonalds all over america and even in several other countries i have to say this is probably one of the worst mcdonalds i have ever been to other than the one in manila in the philippines and that is only because i am not sure that what was in those burgers was even beefwhere do i begin the service is terrible i have never not one time gotten what i ordered i get sweet tea when i ask for unsweetened i get cheese when i ask for none i get onions when i ask for none i get 2 chicken sandwiches when i ask for 4 apple pies i have given up on going through the drive thru because i always end up having to pull around park go in and wait in the long line of teenagers getting shakes just to get them to correct my order and even then they do not get it right and i actually have to tell them no see this is a chicken sandwich i ordered a mcdoublethe food is almost always cold the burgers are dry and taste like they have been sitting on a shelf for more than an hour and the frysugh when there are 6 cars in the drive thru and 20 people in line i just do not understand how the frys can be cold and stale it absolutely defies logic yes there are times that the food comes out hot it is one of the reasons i keep going back there is nothing like hot frys from mcdonalds and also just because it is mcdonalds like it or not it is a staple for working parents too tired to cook dinner after work some nights it is unfortunate that they have no competition in the immediate area to keep them on their toes otherwise they might actually try to improve their service and their product i am sure they are turning a profit no doubt it seems to always be busy however i truly believe that if any other burger joint opened up right next door this place would close down in a month every time i say i am never going back i still do unfortunately tonight will be one of those nights as the kids specifically requested it the shear dread of what i am about to go through is what prompted this review i really hope they improve it hurts to have to knock a mcdonalds, The food is almost always cold and the burgers are dry and taste like they have been sitting on a shelf for more than an hour and the frysugh when there are 6 cars in the drive thru and 20 people in line i just

my visit here was my cycling lunch stop so i was probably more happy than the average patron to see these golden arches this mcds is renovated in the darkwoodmeetsquasistarbucksstyle and while all appeared trendy and chic one could even watch the game on the suspended flatscreen tv closer inspection revealed a floor that needed to be swept and a few tables that required a good wipedown we had to wait longer than i wanted 10 minutes for my food but then again i was only half done my 50 mile ride at that point and wanted food now also exacerbating the wait i know that drivethru customers get priority due to corporate demanding fast ordertoreceipt times however my fries were salty and hot my burger was fresh and tasted the same as other mcds burgers i have consumed and child chatter was minimal , McDonald's is renovated in the darkwoodmeetsquasistarbucksstyle .

knowing how bad the drive through service has been i went inside and placed an order for a burger the lobby was not trashed but in a need of a sweep and a wipe down i ordered my habanero quarter pounder and sat at one of the only clean tables in the store the register guy did come out to sweep and while he did try his best i have to wonder why he choose to move the chairs at my table and sweep below my feet remember that it was the only clean table in the store and ignore what i am only guessing was a hunk of apple on the floor at the table across from me or the fry and salt residue on the seats of the same table he even went so far as to pick up a stack of napkins from the floor and put them onto the table top i know i know young kid working his first job trying so hard but hethey desperately need to go back to the mcdonald university and get some remedial training or this store is going to fail to earn repeat business from its locals, McDonald's drive through service has been so bad that i went inside and placed an order for a burger .

i used to go to this one a lot when fast food was a regular staple in my diet in my 20s when my metabolism was faster and when exercise was not such a priority this is one of the older ones in town recently we went through the drivethru window for some fruit smoothies there were a couple cars in front of us clear mike speedy checkout nice girls the correct order and greattasting smoothies we only go to mcds for a few things parfait cone and sometimes the breakfast sandwich and even then it is pretty sporadic maybe a few times a year because of the lifestyle changes we made since maintaining our weight, i used to go to this one a lot when fast food was a regular staple in my diet in my 20s when my metabolism was faster and when exercise was not such a priority this is one of the older ones in town recently .
i do not think this mcd has ever been remodeled other than a badass painting of the mckingdom there was another thing hanging on the wall which was pretty much a quilt with like cactus cacti sewn in to it and there was another case that had a bunch of old pins and buttons and i do not think there was a pin that was made later than 1982 or something one was for mcdonalds pizzathis thing the painting was pretty badass though that is why i took the pic it is like 10 x 6 i think it was dated 1979 which makes sense considering that mayor mccheese is there and the mckingdom is there tooi swear that place has been forgotten in time not only did it have the vintage artwork but the soda fountain was probably from the 80s as well because the ice machine and sodas were completely separate machines and there was a pay phone outside but it was not right outside the store it was across the parking lot kind of in the bushes and had some weird phone company that i never heard of on it plus it had an electronic sliding door on the main entrance and the play place was outdoors and even had a sing that said please do not feed the birds such a weird place it is cool because it reminds of the way mcdonalds was when i was a kid but it is scary because it is not intentionally retro it just never changedit is quite the experience it is like the classic mcdonalds on flamingo but a different kind of classic, i do not think this mcd has ever been remodeled other than a badass painting of the mckingdom there was another thing hanging on the wall which was pretty much a quilt with like cactus cacti sewn in

i try to steer clear of fast food when i can but sometimes they just sound so delicious or they are the most convenient to have for instance the daughter was hungry and i was in a rush to get ready for an event and this mcdonalds was across from sls which at the day of our visit to mcdonalds was not open yet and therefore did not have functional restaurants yet we went through the drive thru and it was easy and manageablethis is a typical mcdonalds with nothing to make them more memorable than other locations in a good or bad way but if you are staying in the vicinity and in need of fast food do try them their drive thru is also open 24 hours so they are very convenient if you need calories late at night which happens a lot in las vegas go figure overall not a bad mcdonalds, i try to steer clear of fast food when i can but sometimes they just sound so delicious or they are the most convenient to have .

fast food typically just is what it is but this particular mcdonalds was awfulthe service was terrible the cashier had an attitude not only with me but pretty much every customer that came through her line in the 15 minutes i waited to get my food basic big mac  fries nothing special she forgot to give me my drink and when i asked her for it she tried to give me the size below what i ordered when i asked for the right size she practically insisted i take the smaller one then when my order was up and i asked for ketchup she rolled her eyes and acted like i was making her go so far out of her way to reach under the counter then when i went to the fountain to get my drink there were small bugs flying all around itbest part was when i got back and ate my food and realized that my fries were cooked in the same fryer the do the fish in pretty sure those are supposed to be separate threw those out so ended up not needing the ketchup anyways definitely do yourself a favor and go to a different location, Fast food typically just is what it is but this particular mcdonalds was awfulthe service was terrible .

i cannot give a 4 or 5 star rating for any junk food place such as mcdonalds their food is not fresh but frozen so really the only rating aside from food is the cleanliness staff etcthis place is packed and understaffed it was about midnight and i could see 2 people working behind the counter making the food the manager was doing her best to keep the food coming out of the kitchen but clearly was short handed napkins were empty and floors were stickythe food even tasted worse by mcdonalds standards just not a good experiencei come to mcdonalds for emergencies only, i cannot give a 4 or 5 star rating for any junk food place such as mcdonalds their food is not fresh but frozen so really the only rating aside from food is the cleanliness staff etcthis place is packed and under

just an unpleasant experience i live here in las vegas and will often take family to the strip when they come to town we were looking for a late night bite to eat and decided on mcdonalds since it was right in the hotel the servers were incredibly rude my aunt had only asked if they were serving smoothies and the girl behind the register rolled her eyes and responded with an attitude after receiving our food i had asked another employee where i could find straws she intentionally ignored me upon my first attempt to get her attention when she finally turned around after talking to her friend she acted as if i was burdening hermaybe i am expecting too much from a fast food place on the strip but i feel that if you are working in customer service you should be providing customer service not acting as if you are still in high school and hanging onto that angsty teenager we all have inside us, i live in las vegas and will often take family to the strip when they come to town .

this is by far the worst service i have ever had in any fast food restaurantnow i understand that working fast food is not easy but having a burger tossed at me was the end of the line enough said so upset that i tossed right back at the rude ass lady behind the counter if you can wait a couple more feet there are way more options than this pile of dump the only thing worse than having to walk through the excalibur is walking by that stink hole, this is by far the worst service i have ever had in any fast food restaurant .

on christ almighty here it goes if i am going to eat overpriced mcdonalds in a casino i better get what the hell i want to eat this place is so pitiful just thinking about it makes me angry i do not even know where to start besides starbucks and krispy kreme this is your only option for late night eats at the excalibur here it goesvisit 1 fool me onceshame on youmy husband and i head to the room early our first night in vegas because we were tired after a long drive after watching some tv my husband said he wanted a little something from our local mcdonalds i was not really hungry but i was craving a little something sweet so i asked him to get me a mcflurry and to call me and tell me what kind they have he calls and they have oreo mm and butterfinger yum i want butterfinger i exclaimed he hangs up and calls back about a minute later to break the news to me that they are out of butterfinger that wouldve been useful info to have when he first asked so i ended up with oreo he comes back and i take a bite of my mcflurry for those who may not know a mcflurry is soft serve icecream mixed with whatever topping you get how do you possibly mess that up messing up a mcflurry is equal to the stupidity of burning cornflakes there is no excuse i took one bite and threw it away the icecream was warm and the oreo chucks were stale nasty my husbands burger and fries turned out ok at least visit 2 fool me twiceshame on me after some late night gambling i was hungry and did not feel like searching for late night eats so i ventured into this hell hole again i figured since i was getting regular food this time it would be ok the customer service of this place is atrocious you are pretty much the only 24 hour operation that offers more than donuts and coffee so change your attitude my husband had a sweet tooth this time and wanted a mcflurry dun dun dun i order my food and ask for a oreo mcflurry and the guy behind the counter proceeds to tell me that the icecream machine is locked excuse me wtf i call my hubby and tell him and he is most thispleased after two minutes of straight cursing he asks for chocolate chip cookies they have none the only had oatmeal raisin which i can only describe is the asshole of cookies so literally they have no good desserts so my poor baby goes without what he wants we are not doughnut fans so krispy kreme is not really appealing after that i was done with that place for goodif you are ok with mcdonalds go to the one at the luxor you will probably get better service we should have if you want something better venture into nyny into america cafe which is open 24 hours and for the same price you can get some decent food and service, The customer service of this place is atrocious .

this place is a joke it is thisgusting enough of a fact that the only thing to eat at excalibur between the hours of 0200 and 0600 is mcdonalds starbucks and krispy kreme but then to be forced to go to mcdonalds and find this pitiful excuse of an establishment instead for shame the first night they ran out of butterfinger topping for a mcflurry the second night they claimed their ice cream machine was locked not broken but locked wtf is that if you are the only late night eatery available you better have all your menu items available because i have a bit of a sweet tooth this place is a joke do yourself a favor and walk across the footbridge to new york new york and eat at america their late night cafe, excalibur is the only late night eatery available between the hours of 0200 and 0600 is mcdonalds starbucks and krispy kreme .

about as average as your local mcdonalds can be this one is right up middle alley not great but not spectacular either i just find it surprising the skinnyrichieconstant workoutie people up here in summerlin keep this place busy i mean literally not even a block away is lifetime fitness that place is hardcorefood  ok service  ok fast and efficient as a colonoscopy really nothing of greatness at this mcdonalds really run of the mill we often visit this location if we are staying in the nearby red rock casino although i would suppose this location stays steadily busy is in part because of the tourists that stay at the red rock as well and want cheap eats while on vacation gotta make up for all those lost wagesnewest thing at mcdonalds is their healthconscious egg white delight mcmuffin definitely a healthier take on their breakfast menu and yes i fell for that damn 1 coupon conveniently stuck to my mcdonalds bag and tried one myself being a bit of a health nut cannot complain this egg white creation is pretty tasty grilled egg whites canadian bacon eh and white cheddar all on a toasted english muffin all for only 250 calories yeah for a dollar i really liked it but at the regular price of almost 3 i would have probably passed with coupon for 1 and a 1 coffee it made for a nice meal on the small scale of economy i almost almost added a 1 hash brown luckily i passed and decided to save my money  calories for laterother than that i think majority of people around the world know what mcdonalds offers on their menu if you do not dang you must be living under a rock or possibly a place where there is no mcdonalds within your vicinity like under a rock, About as average as your local mcdonalds can be this one is right up middle alley not great but not spectacular either i just find it surprising the skinnyrichie people up here in summerlin keep this place busy .
i went to this location a couple of weeks ago this is how my visit wenti pulled in the drive thru a few minutes before 1030am just in time for breakfast i was the only person in the drive thru so i pulled right up to the menui waited for someone to take my order at the speaker but no one said anythingfinally an employee with an headset walked out of the back room of mcdonaldsi figured this was because the order speaker was broken or somethingbut no the employee walked over and flipped the menu from breakfast to lunchtimei was thinking in my head  whaaaaaaaaaaaaaatkeep in mind my car is right there i am obviously waiting to orderthen the employee turned around and walked back into mcdonaldsthen someone started taking my order over the speakeri ordered my breakfast items which they informed me they were no longer serving i was thinking in my mind do you not think i just saw you walk out and turn the menu i mean my car was like 2 feet away from youanyway i was craving breakfast so i let them know i wanted to cancel my orderi was told the breakfast hours were overthen  magically  like a christmas miracle they had breakfast for metruth is i was willing to leave mcdonalds with out my breakfast food i have a rule for myself i never fight with people that make my food behind closed doors yea maybe paranoid but sadly its a reality so i was completely polite about canceling my order i do believe they did the right thing by offering me these breakfast items where i find the problem is the simple lack of customer service that conversation of them no longer serving breakfast was one we should have never had implying that my order was an inconvenience when clearly it should not have been so then i went back a few days later because i am the type that gives second chances and they missed a few items that i had ordered meaning i ordered them saw it on the drive thru order menu screen paid for it and it was not in my bag when they gave me my orderyea this is a long review i would honestly be surprised if someone read down this far props to you if you have but the whole reason behind it is that i am just super tired of getting terrible customer service and paying for food that i do not get the reason this review is only 1 star is because i have given this place multiple visits and keep coming up with the same problem bad customer service, i went to this location a couple of weeks ago this is how my visit wenti pulled in the drive thru a few minutes before 1030am just in time for breakfast . i was craving breakfast so i let them know i wanted to

yesit has come to this i only feel compelled to write this review because i work nearby and i visit this mcdonalds at least once a week i admit i am a dollar menu addict where else can you get reasonably full for less than 5 for lunch nevermind the guilt and dangerous chemicalsanyway the set up of the drive through makes for a real pain during peak lunchtime hours this mcdonalds is situated in a busy shopping center right next to a starbucks del taco albertsons bank of america and other shops things get rather congested and hard to maneuver however as mcdonalds goes it is fine the service is usually friendly and prompt although the new guy they have in the drive thru is a tad too chatty and they have not messed up my order freshness and hotness varies however, The set up of the drive through makes for a real pain during peak lunchtime hours .

this mcdonalds is connected to the terribles convenience storegas station and not particularly one of my favoritesit is convenient when youre driving down blue diamond from the west but i think the staff could use some training in the customer service end from the other mcdonalds nearbythe last time we ate there we watched and listened as one of the staff members hollered from the dining area to the kitchen apparently she was on break and eating and still wanted to maintain her conversation with her colleagues so she continued it by screaming across the dining room and they in turn hollered back very professional group herei am sure all the other customers enjoyed the show as well, Staff could use some training in the customer service end from the other mcdonalds nearby .

the drive thru sucks i mean the food comes out quickly and whether ordering inside or in your car you get it fast a plus being you can hit the convenience store and get gas or snacks but literally the drive thru dumps you at the entrance and exit on rainbow blvd and its hard to get out and if you come in the wrong way you have to flip a you turn to get into the drive thru to late for them to redo it now i guess when im on that side of town ill venture inside from now on, The drive thru dumps you at the entrance and exit on rainbow blvd and its hard to get out .

this is a prime location for residents of mountains edge sitting on such a busy corner the fries here are always tasteless and soggy they are slow to move the drive through along and parking is difficult based on the building configuration if i feel like grabbing a 2 value meal i much rather travel to the mcdonalds 4 miles north on rainbow, The fries here are always tasteless and soggy .

this review is only for the one in rainbow and blue diamond of southwest vegas i go here because it is one of the few mcdees thats open 24hrs menu and taste is the same as the other mcdees around town would have gotten one more star if they served breakfast before 5am because i went at 440am and they were just doing the lunch menu still they denied me of a good warm hearty breakfast and had to settle for an unhealthy big mac combo with a coke, This review is only for the one in rainbow and blue diamond of southwest vegas . i go here because it is one of the few mcdees thats open 24hrs menu and taste is the same .

this particular location has by far the worst service overall i am not lying when i say that 7 out of 10 visits whether it be drivethru or walkin something is wrong with my order i can remember my order for extra onions on mcrib sandwiches or hamburgers have been produced with extra pickles and no onions a recent visit took 25 minutes to produce a 10 piece chicken mcnuggets and a soda i have worked at a mcdonalds before and if i had a valid food card and ambassadorial privileges i could have changed the oil reheat the fryer located a box in their freezer and fry my own food and still get to school on time the shift manager gave me a large fries and 2 cups for drinks not being sensitive to the fact that i had diabetes and i had ordered nuggets for speedy service and avoidance of excess carbsthe service today was not as bad but why do they go through the trouble of asking what kind of sauce do i want with my nuggets if they are not going to give it to me the guy at the window actually tried to shove me out of drivethru with only a partial order this particular instance has happened several timesunfortunately i am a fan of their products and when i get a hankering and wish not to get out of my vehicle this is the closest locationi have managed 3 food service installations and i guarantee that i could run that place better than the current crew given minimal trainingi would say the 80s had lousy fashion 90s had lousy music and so far aside from drivers of today customer service is at its worst especially for food service and more especially for mcdonalds on sunset and stephanie, This particular location has by far the worst service overall i am not lying when i say that 7 out of 10 visits something is wrong with my order .

status upon arrival hungover starving filthy 3 hours of sleepeven though mcdonalds is known to be fast food as in fast service we love to request our angus burgers fresh upon order waiting the extra 10 minutes okay so we starved more than we had to but finally after receiving our food the first thing my cousin noticed was how old the patties were little did they know my cousin worked at mcds for over two yearsif your going to give us crap anyways give a lame excuse instead of having your customers starve for no reason this branch definitely failed to meet our hunger satisfaction, The first thing my cousin noticed was how old the patties were little did they know my cousin worked at mcds for over two years .
hands down worst mcdonalds weve ever visited fairly nice employees but slow service the place was almost empty but it took nearly 20 minutes to get our food low quality ingredients my prepackaged side salad was filled with wilted iceberg and dry carrot shavings inconvenient you have to ask for them to unlock the bathrooms and you have to show a receipt for refills poor service they were out of water cups even though they just gave one to the guy before me and wouldnt give me something else for water instead, The place was almost empty but it took nearly 20 minutes to get our food .

this is a large relatively modernlooking mcds its a bit grimy which in mho kind of defeats the purpose of the remodel why bother making it all pretty  modern if youre not going to wipe it down regularlythe service here is ok food is standard mcds fare the one reason we come here is for the huge fourstory play area the kids enjoy exploring it and i enjoy getting a half hour of sanity theres a small space underneath for littler guys to play in but this playplace is realistically more for older kids who can climb well the kids room is completely closed off from the rest of the restaurant which works great at keeping my boys from running off and theres a separate bathroom in here just for aparents no changing table which for some strange reason seems to be the way las vegas restaurants roll i really hate that therefore they shouldnt be surprised when i change a poopy diaper on one of their posh bench seats since theres nowhere else to do itmaybe then they will wipe it down afterwards but dont count on it, This is a large relatively modernlooking mcds its a bit grimy which in mho kind of defeats the purpose of the remodel .

so it is fast food and mcdonalds at that so let us say expectations are very very low sometimes though you just want food that is fast and you know what to expect not every meal can be a 5 star dinner with an executive chefeven with appropriate low expectations this location takes the cake for subpar service about a week ago i was exhausted and needed something to eat and there are few fast food restaurants near where i live so off to mcdonalds i went ordered a value meal and a single apple pie surpriseno pie ok mistakes happen i have worked drive through in a previous life and i get it even though it was 10 pm and i was the only car there so it is not like they were rushed stillmistakes happenfast forward to tonight again about 10 pm and exhausted and decide to go crazy and get mcds twice in 1 week so i try again to order an apple pie with my value meal now maybe this is my fault because i should have checked the bag before driving off but after sitting at the window and waiting for 5 minutes and remember i was really tired silly me thought they would be able to get it straight this timeturns out i was wrong yet againno pie both times within a week of each other i paid for them neither time they felt it necessary to put it in the actual bagso i called to talk to the manager and get hung up on as soon as i ask for the manager so i called back the manager actually answered and i told him what happened he did not sound too thispleased just told me next time well get your order rightyeah if there is a next time, This location takes the cake for subpar service .

i was hopping after they spent so much money on redecorating that this mcdonalds would improve on customer service and cleanliness boy was i wrongthe family bathroom does not have a changing table it was totally out of toilet paper and the hand dryer was broken i informed 2 managers of this but they did nothing to rectify the at least one issue they could there are no paper towels just the hand dryer so one could be up the proverbial s creek without anything to clean up with nastyi also informed the same managers that there were spills one water one bubbles in the play area but no one ever came to clean them and my daughter almost slipped through one of the spills they did not even put a warning sign out i also reiterated about the toilet paper and took it upon myself to place napkins on the sink the food was not hot in fact barely warm the napkin used on the floor where the water spill was was black when i cleaned the area myself i do not work there but should have earned a paycheck instead of paying them for what we had, i was hopping after they spent so much money on redecorating that this mcdonalds would improve on customer service and cleanliness boy was i wrong .

firsti know it is a mcdonalds so what could i expect how about a clean space and staff that at least pretended to carethis store is close to the house and our grandson wanted his birthday party herethe store had a recent makeover and on first appearances is a very nice location they obviously spent some money on the makeover that is why the cleanliness or lack thereof was rather shocking the dining area by the childrens play area appears to be an afterthought when they are cleaning i ended up cleaning our tables myself since no one seemed to care enough to come wipe down tables or throw away trash the food was standard fare at mcdonalds but they were really slow filling the orders and it was only lukewarm when we got to the tablesthe play area also had one other major issue they have a little area with animals for the smaller kids to crawl around on i give them points for that and trying to keep the really wee ones away from the bigger kids i would have thought that someone would have though of affixing the animals in some way so they would not tip over when the kids were on them a definite safety hazardnot a store i care to revisit luckily my grandson is now 5 and his palate will soon outgrow mcdonalds, The cleanliness or lack thereof was rather shocking the dining area by the childrens play area appears to be an afterthought when they are cleaning .

this location is really close to where i live and we go here all the time poor food quality at night you would think that the food would be fresher at night because of the slower business i ordered a filet of fish a few times from here and i recieved a stale fish sandwich and  the fish look and felt so stale like it was thrown away earlier in the day and dug out the trash and put on a bun my friend had gotten a double cheese burger and when she bit into and look at it as a piece of mop string in her burger that is thisgusting we took it back got a fresh burger and fo a gift i guess they gave us free stale pies lol gotta love it, The food quality at night is poor at night because of the slower business at the restaurant .

i am not a big mcdonalds fan in fact i do not like their food at all but i was with people who wanted to eat here so i was captive i had an angus snack wrap which was not much more than a hamburger wrapped in a very small flour tortilla it was actually pretty tasty but what i was most impressed with was the dinning room it looked more like an upscale english country hunting lodge plaid wallpaper brass chandelier and fixtures with dark wood trim the only thing that spoiled the atmosphere of fine dining was the playground with huge windows and the screams of kids at play, i am not a big mcdonalds fan in fact i do not like their food at all but i was with people who wanted to eat here so i was captive i had an angus snack wrap which was not much more than a

i apologize ahead of time to the owners for giving bad publicity to this mcdonalds but over the few times i have visited this location i have not had one good experience 3 points for the double k to consider1 if a customer asks for a refund after waiting over 25 minutes for a 4 piece nugget meal for their kid your managers should show some sort of logic when dealing with upset people maybe asking for the reason why a refund is being requested maybe even go so far as to motivate the employees to not spend the majority of their shift texting on their phones2 if your staff cannot handle the business from the counter and the drive through at the same time maybe not such a good idea to add another drive through lane another way to slam the staff with orders they cannot fill within a reasonable time3 in the process of remodeling any of your locations and there is no regular restaurant seating a suggestion to accommodate your customers during this temporary situation would be to keep the play place seating open until close so customers have a place to eat inthere are many more i could give but here are just a few suggestions from 3 separate visits in hopes the reason for this kind of service is due to you guys not knowing what goes on in this restaurant, i apologize ahead of time to the owners for giving bad publicity to this mcdonalds but over the few times i have visited this location i have not had one good experience .

every time i go to this mcdonalds i swear the line cook must be a smoker with no taste buds no matter what sandwich i get it is way over salted they seriously ruin the food every time i visit which is daily as i work in the mall they have decent customer service some are more polite and knowledgeable however i do not think the others have business holding a customer service job, every time i go to this mcdonalds i swear the line cook must be a smoker with no taste buds no matter what sandwich i get it is way over salted they seriously ruin the food .

this is the only mcdonalds near my work and probably for everyone else unless you you drive south into dt portland or go across the bridge tried to give this place a chance after a couple of screw ups but i just cannot do it anymore and heres whyone look at the storefront photo i uploaded that photo here at the time of this review but it was originally taken early in the year mainly because i had another bad experience and i need to tell everyone not to come here any more because they suckso the first time as the photo shows a dead small black fly on the lettuce in my classic crispy chicken sandwich i usually order it without mayo and when i got my sandwich the 1st time guess what it had mayo i just do not get why they cannot read instructions properly or anything why cannot the condiment be separate and not default it is so frustrating any way 2nd time i got the sandwich they got it right except for the fly part i already went in my car so i said f it so i just took the picture as proof and then ripped the contaminated area on the lettucei did not go to this location for awhile after this incident but i was craving chicken mcnuggets and so since it is not a fresh produce item or whatever i decided it wouldnt be a big deal boy was i wrong i think this might have happened twice but i counted my nuggets and it was missing 1 in the 10 or 20 piece meal i should not have to count how many nuggets i have but sadly these people cannot do their job i do not even get much time to eat lunch so i did not have time to go back and complain i am done with this location any way so if i am craving a sandwich or chicken mcnuggets from here i will just drive across the bridge and go there because it probably is not crap like this location they know they are serving a ton of people since they are the only location but they just do such a bad job the fries are a bit overpriced too and some other things in case any of you were thinking you can get a decent deal on large fries the best place for that would be the beaverton location near uwajimaya off highway 10 i think that is itconclusion if you crave mcdonalds don t go to this location unless you want dead flies in your burgerssandwiches or missing chicken mcnuggets, This is the only mcdonalds near my work and probably for everyone else unless you you drive south into dt portland or go across the bridge .

i would safely guess that this is a franchise and if the owner reads reviews you need to re train or fire your current staff we never eat fast food for a variety of reasons the off chance we stopped by and the only time the order was unacceptable we asked for freshly made items and instead got the leftovers of stale food we asked specifically for certain items to be left off the meal to which our request was ignored we paid over 10 for a meal that no one ate while attempting to give your location employee feed back they could not be bothered clearly my phone call was interfering with their priorities and their lack of concern only impacts your bottom line we would never go backedited to add when you are told to wait so they can cook your food to make sure it is newly made and fresh they should be able to stand by their word i was lied to and while i waited an additional few moments clearly my meal was not freshly made it was stale and old i realize this is fast food but the one time i go and request to have food made specifically so i can eat it they ignore my request lie to me and then proceed to charge me for food that was not edible thank goodness i am a healthy eater lesson learned, The only time the order was unacceptable we asked for freshly made items and instead got the leftovers of stale food . i would safely guess that this is a franchise and if the owner reads reviews you need to re train or fire your current

what am i supposed to say it is a mcdonalds i am not expecting much just get the order right and put my food in the bag is quick as you can it is so simple but yet you mess up almost every time that must be why everybody has such a poor attitude who works there they are so defensive from being yelled that all day long from screwing up you would think that would be humbling and you would be apologetic to your customers but instead you choose the road of confrontation what do you expect from somebody who qualifies for the same job as somebody who has murdered 30 people just got out of prison and dropped out of school in the third grade by the way this unhappy interaction was with the store manager probably gets beat it home so when she comes to work it is her time to have a power trip and act like she wears the pants for once in her life thanks for the wonderful dining experience, What do you expect from somebody who qualifies for the same job as somebody who has murdered 30 people just got out of prison and dropped out of school in the third grade .

went through the drivethru and had no issues the outside is very pretty and nice looking the only downside to this mcdonalds i had was the entrance and exit which is very confusing if you do not know how to get there it is one of those locations where you can see where you want to go but the city through one ways and islands prevents you from reaching it you have to go around the block and come in from behind it on a small side street with no sign indicating you need to turn there to get to it, The only downside to this mcdonalds i had was the entrance and exit which is very confusing if you do not know how to get there .

on my way to the local brewery not too far from here we decided to grab a bite to eat beforehand we pulled into the drive through because getting out just seemed like an unnecessary risk as we waited and finally got up to the menu the order taker informed us that they were only accepting cash at the moment my driver decided to exit the line but i insisted on getting him a meal i risked life and limb to get that man dinner i agree with the other reviewers that this place is less that satisfactory the cashier was not even the slightest bit delightful in my ordering experience the restaurant did not look very clean the employees were arguing about something very loudly that made me a bit uncomfortable anyway i got the food and got out of there asap i will not be back unless it is the last place on earth to get food, The restaurant did not look very clean and the employees were arguing about something very loudly that made me a bit uncomfortable anyway i got the food and got out of there asap i will not be back unless it is the last place on earth

i stopped at this location with my boyfriend earlier this evening to grab a bite to eat after stopping off to pick up some things for his apartment and this was one of the most ghetto mcds i have been to i have seen some pretty bad places but this place took the cake in terms of filth and vagrancy because the place seemed to be a location for people to loiter around in and having people up in there begging for change and all while youre trying to order your food i was waiting with my fiance for his food to come up and the guy behind the counter was banging his hand saying can i help the next customerreally you think you can get someones attention banging your hand on the counter like some ignorant fool with no professional standards who would want to eat in this place with folks standing outside trying to sell you stuff and this one guy was begging for change to allegedly feed his baby sisterthat is so typical for them to sit there and lie because they want someone to give them money so they can feed their whatever habit they are trying to hide this restaurant is situated in one of the most ghetto neighborhoods on the west side which says how the standards has gone down if they really cared they would keep the restaurant clean inside and outside and i was glad that i did not see the inside of the bathroom because if it is a ghetto mcdonalds the bathrooms wouldnt exactly look like they were maintained well either i wouldnt bother eating here unless you want to be harassed by goofy hoodrats and crack fiends looking for someone to give them change i can think of at least 10 mcdonalds locations that has staff that do not look like they were plucked from the ghetto garden because this mcdonalds seems to employ hoodrats and ghetto snots to work at this particular location i have gotten much better service elsewhere than this place i would not be coming here again and i want to be served by someone who can properly wear a hairnet that is not the length of the hairstyle and doesnt look like a hoodrat with multi colored dragon lady tips a mile long, i stopped at this location with my boyfriend earlier this evening to grab a bite to eat .

i do not normally go to mcdonalds but i saw a line of cars in the drive through and thought this place must be excellent to have so many clamoring for their food upon entering this establishment i came upstairs and their varied many and perused the items hoping upon hope that they had foie gras as i had a taste for the liver of a goose it was not to be found they must be animal rights activists that run this establishment i asked the young girl at the counter what their speciality was and she told me the big mac was one of their finer thishes i placed the order along with some french fries i no longer call them freedom fries now that the french have come fully on board with our war against muslim countries jesuischarlie i wonder how these french fries will be served i am imagining they will be garnished with black truffles  i ask for their wine list and am told they do not have one how peculiar for a restaurant that serves french food to my horror no baguettes either my food bill comes to 630 cents imagine that the big mac meal  their finest offering and it is only just over 6 dollars the wait is not long for my entree so glad i did not ask for their freedom onion soup strangely the food is in a box and a carton this must be a new style  the creativity of chefs these days knows no bounds i am impressed i open up the box and there lies this lettucey thing with some kind of salad dressing on it it is cold and damp this must be an artistic statement of some kind possibly a commentary on the ill treatment of the intuit natives at the turn of the last century i am impressed by the chefs social concerns but i had wished that the food was hot i took a bite  i am glad that i sat close to the toilet as i made a run for it they must have been upset that i ordered the foie gras originally they are making me pay for it i know when i have been defeated my pomme frites were hot but lacking any french accoutrements this must be french cooking under the vichy government when the germans took away their cream and tried to make them eat sausages completely defeated i made my way to the exit sign as i heard a cackle of teenage girls laughing at me as i tripped over the yellow wet floor alert signal this is the last time i will ever eat in a french restaurant again perhaps i should have ordered the escargot, i do not normally go to mcdonalds but i saw a line of cars in the drive through and thought this place must be excellent . i asked the young girl at the counter what their speciality was and she told me the big

the reason i gave this mcdonalds 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the young lady that was behind the countershe had great customer service skills and although there were a lot of people in line she seemed to have a system and got the line down pretty quicklyi was also charged 299 for a sausage egg mcmuffin that was listed at 279 and i was given my difference back even though they said the sandwich was suppose to be 299i would have went back to that mcdonalds if i was not at a volunteering event for seniors that day so i had no choice but to choke down my hard crisp eggs burnt muffin and dried out sausagei do not understand where quality control is going for many of these fast food restaurants its like because we have a value menu or a dollar menu we do not have to serve food that is fresh and hoteven if i was in the area unless i was just getting a coffee i wouldnt go back to this mcdonaldsjust so sad, The reason i gave this mcdonalds 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the young lady that was behind the counters .

the people are mostly nice at this location but the service is the slowest i have ever seen at a golden arches the drive thru is always packed but that has less to do with them being busy than it taking forever to get your food when you do finally get your food it is the usual mcdonalds fare so no issues there they are also often out of ice cream which is a drag on a hot summer day when that is all you crave when possible i go to the mcdonalds a little farther north on king drive, The people are mostly nice at this location but the service is the slowest i have ever seen at a golden arches .

i am not a huge fan of mcdonalds in general but i do eat at a mcdonalds about once a month or so this mcdonalds is one of the worst that i have been to the service inside was very slow the manager who was helping run the cash register with another employee kept allowing other people to jump in line and then looked at the rest of us with this look ofyou do not mind do you we decided to go through drive through instead hoping for faster service we got to the speaker and the employee asks what do you want not a how can i help you or anything semicustomer service oriented we decided to order anyway because my daughter was really excited for some fries otherwise we would have left at this point we placed our order and then pulled up to pay she told us one amount and then ended up giving me change for another amount however i did not happen to check it until i had pulled up to the next window we pulled up to get our order at the 2nd window and the employee asked us what we had ordered not just an item or two so she could make sure we were the next order but she wanted to know everything we had ordered i am not sure why there was an issue in relaying the information from the 1st window to the 2nd especially with computers the 2nd window employee was nice and even wished us a good day the order was right and the fries were hot upon looking at the receipt the cashier did give me the correct change she just said the wrong amount when it comes to ordering it really bothers me when you walk into a restaurant that has their breakfast menu up even though they say they are not serving breakfast anymore inside the breakfast menu was up but they told others they were not serving it anymore in the drive thru we asked just in case because i really wanted a sausage biscuit but they said again they werent serving breakfast the biggest problem with this was that because the breakfast menus were up the lunch menus were not and you would have had to know exactly what you wanted to get we ended up getting the basics fries hamburger drink i do not have the number meals memorized and i swear they are different at each mcdonaldsoverall the service was slow and the employees were rude it was not busy during our visit it was 11am right before the lunch rush i would avoid this mcdonalds if you can, Service inside was very slow and the manager who was helping run the cash register with another employee kept allowing other people to jump in line and then looked at the rest of us with this look ofyou do not mind do you we decided to

my expectations for mcdonalds in general are pretty low but this one lowered the bar yet another notch drove through at 1140 pm on sat feb 26 ordered 2 quarter pounder with cheese with a bottle of water  i never customize because that increases the probability of mistakes burger was fine fries were cold and rubbery i am guessing that the fries had been sitting for some time to begin with and they put em in the bag while waiting for the burger i drove away before i thiscovered the cold fries did not feel like turning around and going back worst part might have been the guy who handed the food out the window without a greeting without a thankyou without a word knowing he was serving me crappy cold fries that part really pisses me off i would never accept that kind of service from one of my employees very thisappointed  as usual when will i learn, My expectations for mcdonalds in general are pretty low but this one lowered the bar yet another notch .

normally i do not bother reviewing places like this but this mcdonalds is so hilariously awful that i felt it was my duty to share this information with fellow yelpersthe irony of this specific mcdonalds is that it is an exceptionally nice one both inside and out it is ultramodern with a great little outdoor garden with seats i have never seen a mcdonalds like this beforeunfortunately it is absolute chaos inside as some other reviewers have said the staff have no control over it and it turns into a freeforall i honestly think chicago pd needs to have a few officers staffed inside this place 247 since there are always a lot of sketchy things going on i am surprised no one has been stabbed andor shoteven if you are just passing by you will immediately know something is up with this place there are no less than 20 strange characters loitering outside of it pretty much all day making weird comments at strangers again it is nothing short of a miracle that people have not been stabbed or shot here i make it a point to walk past as quickly as possible and not make eye contact since the people loitering out front always give me weird looks and act like they want to fightseriously if this place got bulldozed tomorrow morning i do not think anyone would shed a tear and the adjacent buildings property values would quadruple businesses like this are the reason yelp needs negative starsalso i lold at the photos making this look like a classy place it is not, There are no less than 20 strange characters loitering outside of it pretty much all day making weird comments at strangers again .

i rate this mcdonalds 234 stars its a downtown mcdonalds at the crossroads of state and chicago streets at the entrance to the subway  one word describes this mcdonalds busy it seems that this mcdonalds is marketed to the commuters exiting the subway and driving on chicago street with its giant arches hanging above the subway exit at chicago street the result is that this mcdonalds is busy even outside there are usually people hanging out including the homeless this mcdonalds is relatively large there was no problem getting a table and there was breathing room because this mcdonalds is busy and the employees were overworked while being on the friendly side i will not dwell on the fact that they forgot my order and napkins i will just knock off half a star this mcdonalds is convenient and relatively inexpensive whether its one or five stars the convenience and ample seating makes up for the flaws closing up this review i have two tips if you are not in a rush i recommend the cool rock  roll mcdonalds and if you want great chicken nuggets and waffle fries chickfille is a couple doors down, This is a downtown mcdonalds at the crossroads of state and chicago streets at the entrance to the subway .

my impression of this place is still that it should probably be razed to the ground they only sell bottled water at this mcdonalds even though the area in front of the building is the site of known and newsworthy episodes of wilding with about 200 teenagers trying to cause trouble out front not only do they have terrible security guards tons of unruly teens and others but they cannot even accommodate a customer by doing something so simple as selling and providing a cup of water with ice in it even though they can make an iced coffee pullleeezzzeeethey ought to hire a private special ops security force to stand out front so that the 5 policemen who seem to be permanently stationed there can spend their time other places too, My impression of this place is still that it should probably be razed to the ground .

three cardinal sins1 the ice cream cones cost twice as much here as other locations around chicago granted this means i am paying 108 instead of 054 some might say it is pointless to critique this  it is just fifty cents but i say no they are charging twice the price name another thing sold anywhere at a franchise where the price can vary so wildly also i hate mcdonalds and the only reason i go there is because they are losing money by serving me underpriced ice cream cones  they cannot possibly profit from this moreover cmon an ice cream cone for fifty cents on hot chicago day who could pass that up not even me a mcdonaldshating hippie2 complete chaos at the ordering station even with very little line3 pigeons being fed in the outdoor seating area  by an employee  who alternated from cursing at the pigeons to when they got too close to her throwing fries to get them to get away does she not realize that feeding them just keeps those nastyass pigeons around, Ice cream cones cost twice as much here as other locations around chicago .

today was the breaking point long ago mcdonalds revolutionized the restaurant industry with fast food dining a paragon of what was possible when human ingenuity applied itself to streamline processes and deliver maximum production and food for people in the least amount of time these days efficiency no longer matters and has been replaced with indifference complacency and a lack of thisregard to customer priorities on most mornings i will stop into mcdonalds to grab a yogurt parfait for 112 as my morning breakfast i did it because it was a healthy breakfast tasted good and was amazingly cheap before today one of the top ten things i associate with mcdonalds is efficiency and today i can throw that word out the window because mcdonalds no longer merits ittoday i left my house early for the express purpose of ordering more food for breakfast because i did not have dinner and i was short on sleep and needed a giant coffee to go with some food to keep me sane for a long day at work i arrived at 844am and i know this because foursquare told me so when i checked in something was amiss and there was a large crowd of people and lines that were simply not movinggreat these things sometimes happen which was why i was glad that i left my house early so that if i actually did have to wait in line it wouldnt matter and i would still be able to get what i wanted when i wanted it the minutes started flying by and the line still was not moving what happened to that proud tradition of corporate efficiency to deliver the customer what they wanted when they wanted with the highest degree of professionalism and courtesy well you can all forget about it because it is clear that no one in this mcdonalds during the morning shift gives one iota of care for anyone waiting in linei got to be the third person in line when two customers started to argue with the cashier that they wanted cream on the side of their coffee and not mixed in the clerk wouldnt make a new coffee for the customers and the customers werent having any of it watching these people argue with the clerk got my blood boiling because i was trying to get an order in and get to work on time because of the inability of the clerk to placate these customers i ended up stuck in line waiting waiting and waiting in what seemed to be foreverhaving arrived at 844am it was now 854am and i had not made an order i yelled in frustration about the utter lack of thisregard the staff had much to the amusement of the other patrons who were all either waiting for their order or waiting to order who all were in the same boat i slammed the door on leaving and walked a block over to starbucks at starbucks i spent 5 for a giant cup of coffee and no food  5 i could have easily spent at mcdonalds in order to get what i wanted but apparently mcdonalds no longer cares about earning my money since they are too busy arguing with other customers and making everyone wait to order and wait for their food long gone are the good old days of the quick food restaurant this mcdonalds no longer adheres to any sense of time or service and has degenerated into the ultimate thisplay of incompetency there are not enough words in all of the languages i speak to describe the thisgust that i experienced today at this mcdonalds it was thisgraceful and a thorough exercise in human futility and it was ten minutes of my life that i will never gain back, Today was the breaking point when i was stuck in line at mcdonalds . The line was not moving and the clerk wouldnt make a new coffee for the customers . Two customers started to argue with the cashier that they wanted cream
this mcdonalds has a gentle balance between efficient service and psychotic episodes this location was recently remodeled so the existing clientele of those less fortunate have a bright and open area to hang out the new system of ordering in at one counter and receiveing your food at another seems to work well but i really do not appreciate being told where to stand while waiting for my order i am not a sheep they really need to stop doing that, The new system of ordering in at one counter and receiving your food at another seems to work well but i really do not appreciate being told where to stand while waiting for my order i am not a sheep .

logan square does not have a lot to offer in the fast food lane but when push comes to shove at least mcdonalds is a decent goto right this mcdonalds lives in this world of hipster laissezfair attitude so when something is wrong the answer here is too bad i went to this mcdonalds the other night with my mom and ordered about 16 worth of food including two mcflurrys or soft serve with toppings dumped on top stale chicken nuggets and 2 diet cokes only halfway through our meal did my mom notice her drink tasted funny she looked at her receipt and saw the cashier made one drink a coke zero i went to the counter for her and told samantha the manager that the drink was wrong and i would like a diet coke she said the drink was half empty and i would have to buy a new one the shock on my face washed over her like she was a piece of smooth sea glass my mom also tried to reason with her  should not the customer get what they actually ordered no no you can not samantha then took my moms receipt and threw it away my mom asked for it back so she can officially complain i give them credit for following up but they are a lost cause it was not the 105 it wouldve cost for a new drink it is that samantha and her crew are the most unfriendly group people i have ever experienced and to eat their food again would be to poison myself with their abrasive unhelpful attitude, logan square does not have a lot to offer in the fast food lane but when push comes to shove at least mcdonalds is a decent goto right .

horrible mcdonalds yes i get it its a fast food place and things will get messed up but there is a line everytime i went there something was messed up with my order a couple of time i went there and ordered a large fry and a coke but got a 10 piece chicken nugget with a root beer then the rest of the time i would always get either the wrong drink wrong size of something or the entire order would be all wrong how does that happen every time, Something was messed up with my order a couple of time i went there and ordered a large fry and a coke but got a 10 piece chicken nugget with a root beer .

of all the mcdonalds restaurants in america i believe this is the worstthe parking lot is cramped and begging for a lowspeed crashon a saturday afternoon my friends and i were told no carbonated beverages were available no coke with my mcnuggets criminalthe bathroom doors are locked and require an attendant to unlock them which suggests to me few people have washed their hands before eating and with the length of lines here who would go to the trouble of getting the bathroom opened upand charging for extra condiments wtf, The parking lot is cramped and begging for a lowspeed crash . The bathroom doors are locked and require an attendant to unlock them .
for years i have come to this mcdonalds but as the managers came and went the service and atmosphere has gotten worse and worse i have stopped going here as of january 12011 i will tell you why i stopped in to get my usual order but had to make a call out of state to my mom real quick she did not answered so i left a message just so you know i was not there having a long conversation  and i sat because i do not like talking on a phone as i am in line i ended the call then immediately started looking for an address to someplace i was headed to this all took a few minutes  not ten fifteen or longer  a couple minutes but before i could stand up and head on over to the counter i was approached by i believe the manager who did not start off by saying welcome to mcdonalds i instead got have you ordered yet you can only be here 30 minutes and went into some speech about ordering customers and length of time to be there i was like wth i told them i am a customer and in fact was just there hours earlier for breakfast and before i could say that i am going to order they tapped on the wall as if to say you gotta go and walked away after giving me the third degree and truly made me feel unwelcomed this was a very unpleasant encounter with this manager i have never just sat in a mcdonalds or any venue and not ordered i do not loiter and was quite offended that this person insinuated that in fact i always order and take it home except this day i did sit for a a minute  and earlier at breakfast i ordered my usual grub and sat maybe 57 minutes and took the rest home or two as i completed my call but i just got there and it was like this person appeared out of nowhere and started grilling me what ever happened to welcome to mcdonalds i was stunned and offended at how i was treated never going back burger king may be further away but i would rather go there and not be insulted, for years i have come to this mcdonalds but as the managers came and went the service and atmosphere has gotten worse and worse i have stopped going here as of january 12011 i will tell you why i stopped in to get

despite this being the closest mcdonalds to my place it is not the one i frequent most often i have found the lines both the drive through and inside tend to be very long usually i go down the street to the milwaukeewestern mcdonalds as there is rarely a line and if there is it moves quickly i have had no problem with the food at this location just a preference for fast service, Despite this being the closest mcdonalds to my place it is not the one i frequent most often i have found the lines both the drive through and inside tend to be very long .

the people who work here are great and always cheerful but they really need to replace the sound system for their drive through more often than not they will screw something up especially if it is a larger order however their prices are usually a little better than the mcducks in bucktown that one is overpriced, The people who work here are great and always cheerful but they really need to replace the sound system for their drive through .

ha i read the reviews and could not agree more with whats been said it is still all very true unfortunately based on my personal observation to top it all off i walked into the place to get some food and found my car goneafter my purchase was made a gentleman in the parking lot was kind enough to offer me the address and phone number of the towing facility for whom he worked i do not hold the towing company responsible for doing what they believe is their job i do however hold this business responsible for hiring people without a sense of observation intelligence common sense humility and accountability do not waste your property cash time nor curiosity to even look at this place because it is filthy on the inside the floors of overlooked dirt and grime door handles with more grease than gears in a sewing machine the food always arrives after your next birthday it seems to get when prepared and i do not think anyone has looked up at me once to offer me a sense of being heard and understood when the staff rings up your receipt they do nothing but look on in fatigue at their own reflections and observe a strange sense of love from cold comforts in the scratched up stainedless steel counter topsto the cdc save a life and look twicethe dirt and trained monkeys might have escaped from the same lab and work somewhere inside the only thing fresh in this place is what will be on the toilette paper the next day as a result of the oil that i imagine was obtained from an underworld market exchange fashioned by cheap costs and the flesh of missing persons of course some may say that i inflate the truth consequently that is how you feel when you pay money for something at a place that cheats you out of more than simply the socalled food wellfind out for yourself or continue reading the content which others wrote here to save yourself a hospital bill and walking off 6 pounds to get your car back take our word for it please if you are even an ounce above organ failure from lack of food attempt survival elsewhere to increase your chances of thisappointment thiscovered as much more potentially pleasurable than those found at this location, The only thing fresh in this place is what will be on the toilette paper the next day as a result of the oil that i imagine was obtained from an underworld market exchange fashioned by cheap costs and the flesh of missing persons .

the argument can be made that reviewing a mcdonalds is a waste of everyones time this mcdonalds however warrants special mention although the place is reasonably clean and they generally get your order right the length of time it takes for this to happen is genuinely baffling no matter what time of day you come in or how busy the place happens to be it will always take far longer to complete your transaction than it reasonably should in light of the fact that speed is supposed to be the selling point of a mcdonalds i would call this particular location a failure, The length of time it takes for this to happen is genuinely baffling no matter what time of day you come in or how busy the place happens to be it will always take far longer to complete your transaction than it reasonably should .

the good news  they have just remodeled this place and it it super modernstylish like going to starbucks now for the bad news high volume mcdonalds have been trying different line workflows for the last six months at least at this location and the one in union station and with the recent automation implemented you can expect to wait 10 minutes for a cup of coffee as another review said it is probably because it does seem like chaos to stand in a line 23 deep place your order and then step aside in front of the people who ordered before you so the person fulfilling the order can shuttle to the counter  back delivering your bag of food this actually got you your food pretty quickly even in peak timesso now the newest system is a single register to take orders and an electronic system that shows order numbers that are ready on a tv screen sounds great right not at this location for some reason their fulfillment process is very very slow it took 10 minutes the other day for my order to come up and with the old system it would be 23 minutes consistently i think it was faster because there were four individual teams working on fulfilling orders not a centralized mainly singlethreaded process with the new systemthis morning i walked in saw the line in front of the register was 2 deep and 20 people were waiting for their orders 20 this is not dekalb where a busload of people just walked in it is mcdonalds and they clearly need to to fix something with this store  their new process or just change back to the old chaotic system that got you your food in 23 minutes consistently, The new system is a single register to take orders and an electronic system that shows order numbers that are ready on a tv screen sounds great right not at this location for some reason . With the new system it took 10 minutes the other day
i have nothing bad to say about the actual food or service although as other reviewers have noted this location is not exactly lighting fastthe reason i am writing this review is to warn people that the free wifi weve come to expect from all mcdonalds and that is advertised at this mcdonalds is often not working at this location i have gone there on three seperate occasions within the last three months and have not been able to access their wifiso if youre stopping in mainly for the use of their internet go to starbucks accross the street, i have nothing bad to say about the actual food or service but as other reviewers have noted this location is not exactly lighting fast .

it is fast food right well it is food at leastthere are three mcdonalds within two blocks of my work maybe more for all i know and this one has the worst service of any of them i understand the people working the counter are getting minimum wage or slightly higher and are not super excited about their jobs or innovating the industrybut seriously will someone take my damn order alreadyi cannot count the number of times i have been here where i stand in line at a register and when i finally get to the front the person is running around without any clear direction running food to other registers for the people who arrived after me but were lucky enough to win the register lottery multiple times i have had to get someones attention and remind them that i am still waiting to place my orderit is not rocket science heck it is not even science it is service plain and simple divide and conquer one group of people take orders and another group of people run the food while yet another makes it in the back sounds simple right well it does not appear so simple when you walk into this mcdonaldsi have worked in the food service industry as a waiter and i understand that people have different ideas on what is good service but one thing is always constant greet your customer and communicate with them let them know if youll be a minute inform them if there is a wait whatever the issue just let them know they will appreciate you more for it and be more willing and patient to waitother than the service this is well mcdonalds does not matter which one you go to you get pretty much the same thing that is the hallmark of their business the only difference is serviceso pay attention franchisees mcdonalds may continue to get my money but you independent franchise owners may soon lose valuable customers with poor serviceafterall there is a mcdonalds within a couple miles just about anywhere in developed countries, There are three mcdonalds within two blocks of my work and this one has the worst service of any of them .

i have been to this mcdonalds several times since it is near work i tend to think only people who have had bad experiences will take the time to write a review which i do not think reflects very well for how many people they serve at lunch from lane tech students to nearby workers to families i think they have done a pretty consistent job at being quick and having the food taste good for mcdonalds standardson the downside drivethrough ordering has a bit of an awkward setup especially if you want to head left after you leave they also tend not to accept a lot of promotional coupons the quality of the food dips a bit after lunch, i tend to think only people who have had bad experiences will take the time to write a review which i do not think reflects very well for how many people they serve at lunch . drivethrough ordering has a bit of an awkward setup especially

drivethrough sucks for customers and employees i was here last winter and they built what looks like a parking lot payment booth on the edge of the building so you can pay before you get up to the next window you have to swing sharply around this booth because the lot was most certainly designed before the booth was added last winter i saw a super elder employee wearing a jacket in this booth i am certain they can not keep this booth up to required heat levels in chicago i felt so bad for this old lady wearing a thick coat and scarf the summer before i brought my neice to play in the playhouse and it was hotter than heck in there when i asked for airconditioning they said its broken about a week and a half later it was still hot and still broken or so i was told you think that if a company like mcdonalds called a heating and aircondition company they would be there like super fast i think it was cost cutting saving electricity, drivethrough sucks for customers and employees . The lot was most certainly designed before the booth was added last winter . i am certain they can not keep this booth up to required heat levels in Chicago .

i have been living in this neighborhood since i was 4 back in the day the cheapest place to get a burger and fries was maxwells on 31st in my family during that time eating at mcdonalds was luxury item why was it a luxury because my parents highly frowned upon processed and can foods as a rebellious child growing up eat at a mcdonalds was luxury the closest place without a car had to be in mckinley park fast forward a few years and the mcdonalds express opened despite it being fastfood it poses as a treat to all the locals in the neighborhood after playing sports at mcguane or just grabbing a quick bite this mcdonalds is very small compared to other mcdonalds but they do serve most items since they marketed their 1 menu couple of years ago the dollar menu has never changed mcchickens and mcdoubles were always a 1 now with the advertised 1 breakfast menus and any size drink there are a lot of cheap options my only grievance is that they do not have sweet tea and salads but unsweetened tea is available it does not feel right to goto any mcdonalds for a salad it just does not make sense to mei come here a couple times a month for ice coffee hot coffee and a sandwich or two the location is convenient to grab a quick bite pick up my dry cleaning or pick up a few small items from walgreens the occurrence of panhandlers has increased since pacific garden missions moved to canal st and it has also died down since the new police station has been placed on 31st and halsted slowly and surely this neighborhood is urbanizing i cannot wait to see more of it," Growing up, eating at a mcdonalds was a luxury item for my family .

if i were to die and go to hell this mcdonalds would certainly provide a worthy backdrop for a nightmare imaginedlet us begin the story of my worst dinner of my life at this sad little stop in a strip mall of no particular visual appeal under a bleak and cold chicago evening all things being fair the culinary experience was doomed for failure given certain personal and tragic circumstances i would not get into hereupon stepping to the counter i gave pause to the abbreviated menu not worthy of a mcdonalds express which is a new concept to me alltogether i decided to play it safe with the classic cheeseburger meal with an intimidating amount of fries and drink aka the value meal my meal was served up a little too quickly with all due credit to the server the food seemed to appear from nowhere  gremlins cooking the food i could see the grease seeping through one of the burger wrappers at this point i made a snap substitution request no coke coffee instead  a hot beverage will make the grease go down smoother my server obligated me in silence and i acknowledged her generosity i took my tray and chose a seat by the front windows where parked cars would treat the diner with blinding light from their headlights but at least it was somewhat devoid of the cold glowing light emitting from the overhead florescent located in the rear of the restauranti sat down and emptied the contents of the bag fries and napkins no ketchup i tasted one of the fries to determine if they were worthy of ketchupfree consumption but alas no they were slightly cold with a texture that left an unpleasant lump in your throat i fetched several ketchup packets from the server kept under tight security behind the counter and returned to my tablespilling out the ketchup packets on the table i noticed dried droplets of ketchup on the plastic packets no turning back now i dug into my dinner with a overwhelming sadness for humanity and myself so to sum upfries they left an odd taste of seafood or fish to my palette perhaps they comingled food in the fryer the lukewarm temparture made it a bit difficult to choke them down maybe some beer would have helped the processcheeseburgers lifting the top bun of any burger you can tell right away if there was any love in the preparation though consumable the burgers were not satisfying and tasted as if they sat under a heat lamp for too long also lukewarmcoffee i have tasted better coffee from a mechanical contraption in a corporate lunch room it was watery lukewarm and slightly sweet in a way that amplified everything that went wrong with the coffeeketchup packets looks like they were dropped on the floor at some point or recycled from a previous diner that did not use up all their ketchupcustomer service no complaints here it is not exactly the most cheery place to work servers were speedy helpful and responsive, The culinary experience was doomed for failure given certain personal and tragic circumstances i would not get into hereupon stepping to the counter i gave pause to the abbreviated menu not worthy of a mcdonalds express which is a new concept to me
this is a mcdonalds express so it sadly does not have the entire menu at all times it reminds me that advertisements often include participation and availability may vary by location notices  this would be one of those cases fortunately the smaller menu means fewer different things for their cooks to remember how to prepare or thistract them from these key menu itemsover half of the times i have been in here no matter how busy i have had my food handed to me in less than 2 minutes from paying for it that is express peoplethe only thing that drags this place down is the atmosphere the counter is tiny and only holds two registers so at any busy point in time the line of people engulfs the only walking space and makes its way to the door and sometimes extends out the door though i have only seen that during dinner times as i have passed by on my way home from unique or somethingthe soda machine has once or twice been low on syrup yielding a nasty beverage  but it is outside the counter so you can refill it with something else on your own the tables for sitting are very close together meaning it is difficult to eat your food in peace at this location without being bothered by someones family issues or rampant children it can get very loud herebut all in all if youre stopping in for something to go this is a great place for that just make sure to check that what you want is on their smaller menu and take note that sometimes the sales regular mcdonalds can have on menu items does not necessarily apply here so pay attention and then you can enjoy your mcdonalds foodand youll enjoy it better at home instead of sitting in cramped quarters with rambunctious broodlings, This is a mcdonalds express so it sadly does not have the entire menu at all times . The counter is tiny and only holds two registers so at any busy point in time the line of people engulfs the only walking space and
they have bad service and very rude,they have bad service and very rude

this mcdonalds has the worst service of any that i have visited in the world  and i mean that quite literally cold food incorrect orders after long wait times prices on their own menu not even being honored the list goes on and on in fact they automatically upcharge you unless you specify that you only want a small or regular you will be paying almost 10 for a large meal that you did not even want while this sounds like an easy fix if you are not fluent in spanish good luck communicating with any of the employees who work here," this mcdonalds has the worst service of any that i have visited in the world, i mean that quite literally cold food incorrect orders after long wait times prices on their own menu not even being honored the list goes on and on ."

so my first experience with this mcdonalds was the day that i moved in i had a couple friends helping me this mcdonalds is directly across the street from my apartmentso after witnessing a guy smash his van we later were told by the popo that it was stolen into the light pole right at the corner then watching him exit the vehicle and run maniacly down north ave away from the scene we decided we were hungry we thought why not go to mcds seems logical i mean mcds is always the same no matter where you go right and it was certainly conveniently located at least it appears conveniently located oh its not attempting to cross north ave at my intersection is really a situation where you are taking your life into your hands this is a 4 5 6 oh hell i do not even know how many corners there are here intersection and one of the lights is only green for one side of the street but has no sign indicating that anywhere so people either do not stop or just stand there you feel like you are playing frogger except not with a pixellated frog but rather with your own skin and organsif you make it into the building with your spinal cord still attached to your body you will see they always have at least 15 people working here yet there are never more than 2 registers open at once and the only people working those registers are either a ancient nonenglish speaking women b mentally handicapped hey i appreciate their sense of social responsibility to hire the old and degenerate i do not appreciate the game of charades i must play with the cashiers to get my order rightwhile you are waiting the 15 plus minutes it takes to get your food here you may notice that this mcdonalds is a bit different from the rest ricky martin pictures signed selena cds and gigantic enrique iglesias are the decor of choice here apparantly this is the latin rock n roll mcdonalds couple that with the fact that its the only mcdonalds i have ever seen that has jalepenos as a condiment and the fact that they look at me as if i am lost every time i walk in there i think its safe to say the clientele here is pretty setoverall the location service and neighborhood sucks i would give it only 1 star but hey its open 247 and its mcdonalds, The location service and neighborhood sucks . The only one of the lights is only green for one side of the street but has no sign indicating that anywhere so people either do not stop or just stand there .

never thought i would write a review about a mcdonalds but i feel compelled this one was just rebuilt replacing a perfectly servicable old one whatever it is their moneymy problem with the new one is that its parking lot configuration and ease of ingressegress is even more stupid than the old one if that is possible you see if youre coming from the east entrance into the lot either via entrances on north avenue or lowell one way north is no problem if youre coming from the west on north avenue or from the south on kostner you literally cannot enter the parking lot at all i thought by turning left onto kostner a fairly maindrag kind of street i could enter as you could with the old one nope no entrance any more on kostner and you cannot turn left from north avenue to lowell because there is a median i think either way youre risking an accident or a ticket there is an alley directly behind the lot which is not only fenced off from mickey ds but one way going out so i drive around the block past lowell the oneway street next to mcdonalds to kildare back to north avenue then enter jesus the entrance has one of those dividedcurb thingys which was barely wide enough for my compact car there are two drivethru lanes from which to order food but then they merge into one waiting line so you can end up in this single line ahead of someone whos been waiting longer or viceversa so why bother the rest was standard mcdonalds why cannot you at least offer me salsa for my breakfast burritoi got no sauce no ketchup no napkins nuthinok then to get out and go back east on north avenue you must basically repeat the mazebullshit from above only in the reverse you used to be able to exit onto kostner then turn left on north avenue now you are forced to either go west on grand or north avenue or go to lowell north to wabansia past a high school to kildare to north avenue got all that apparently the city thinks it is more desirable for us to drive around an entire neighborhood than to use the only inexplicably oneway alley in the entire neighborhood to get home from fucking mcdonalds i felt like rat in a ghettomaze only with a soontobecold egg mcmuffinso in a nutshell if you live west of here you cannot get in if you live east of here you cannot get out and ya cannot really go north either it is maddening if you must go to this mcdonalds walk or take the bus seriously from my house at the halfway point between the two i will just go down to the one at kedzienorth i realize mcdonalds andor the city are trying to protect themselves from lawsuits from our shitty driving and that badly designed intersection but if it is that dangerous which it is then just do not build it there it is a square lot yet needlessly complicated grrr, The parking lot configuration and ease of ingressegress is even more stupid than the old one . The entrance has one of those dividedcurb thingys which was barely wide enough for my compact car there are two drivethru lanes
drive thru is clueless customer service leaves a lot to be desired i must be honest and state that i have only passed through here for 1 a happy meal for my son or 2 a coffee they have managed to screw both of those up some language barriers exist before you judge i am bilingual englishspanish i have more than once had to clarify drink orders plus my request for salsa for a breakfast burrito resulted in ketchup and not the salsa i wanted aftering stating in spanish what i wanted , Drive thru drive thru is clueless customer service leaves a lot of a lot to be desired .

normally i wouldnt take the time to rate a mcdonalds as the product is relatively consistent across all locations however this location is terrible and deserves to be called out as such this location is the closest to my home and as a result i would go here frequently when the mcdonalds urge arose no more every time i pull in to this place it seems quicker to head inside rather than sit in their slowly creeping drive through only to find out upon arriving home they failed to include an item in my order the employees are an unmotivated bunch who does not seem to care about customer service cleanliness is marginal there are too many other local places to go count me out of this place for good, This location is the closest to my home and as a result i would go here frequently when the urge arose no more .

this might be the prettiest mcdonalds in the area it was recently rennovated in the prairie style frank lloyd wright is a big attraction here in oak park and it resembles a lovely hotel lobby stained glass woodwork even a fireplace the reason they did this is that ray kroc mcdonalds founder was from oak parkthey really need to remodel the staff though you do not expect these folks to be rocket scientists like jackson r but a simple order for two people should not have three mistakes i love their asian chicken salad but half the time i have to ask for the right dressing or the packet of almonds is missing the ugly tiny mcdonalds in the basement of childrens hospital gets it perfect every time, This might be the prettiest mcdonalds in the area it was recently rennovated in the prairie style frank lloyd wright is a big attraction here in oak park and it resembles a lovely hotel lobby stained glass woodwork

this has to be the worst mcdonalds location i have ever been to  it is too bad since it is only a couple of miles away from the corporate headquarters you would think they would be out to impress we walked in with nobody in front of us and waited for someone to even come to the front counter  i always expect to have someone front and center at the counter when i walk in keep in mind that this was 630 on a friday one would think that it would be busy for dinner i should have picked up on the fact that nobody was even there and left  the order was simple the bacon cheeseburger meal and a nugget kids meal  it took forever to fulfill the order  they have everyone running around for the drivethru and the 3 cars in line but nobody helping the front staff meanwhile the manager is peroccupied with filling the refrigerator with apple slices rather than managing the storestaff we finally sit down and every table in the place was dirty i had to grab some napkins and wet them down to clean off the table we sat at  needless to say my daughter is a slow eater so we were there for at least a 12 hour and never saw anyone come and clean tables the food was horrible and not by mcdonalds standards but by human consumption standards  the nuggets were cold the second we opened the bag  the burger was cold and the bun was stale  the french fries were cold and looked like they were sitting around for awhile there was so much salt on the fries that i actually had to throw them away  i love mcdonalds french fries but not when made here i should have learned my lesson the first time i went to this place and the nuggets were cold last time i miss the days when you went into a mcdonalds and heard the sizzle of the grill and the french fry frier beeping that it was done alas steer clear of the yorktown mcdonalds it is nowhere near up to par as far as mcdonalds standards should be, This has to be the worst mcdonalds location i have ever been to  it is too bad since it is only a couple of miles away from corporate headquarters you would think they would be out to impress .

well it may be a brand new store but it still suffers from the same problem as most fast food stores  bad help  i went with my wife and she ordered by number  no problem  i ordered a southwest salad  was asked what type of chicken  i gave my choice  then i was asked about the dressing  i chose the southwest  asked for an extra  was told the total  and paid  waited what seemed like forever and a tray was pushed our direction  i did not see an extra dressing and asked about it  a manager type told me it was 95 extra  i told him i asked for it when i ordered  he looked at the receipt and said i was not charged for it and i would have to pay  it was not the 95 but how he said it he was very condescending for such a young man  we go to wendys on roosevelt in lombard and are treated like kings  i have over the years sworn off mcdonalds for just the same treatment  why do they continue to put people at the register who do not speak english or are just afraid of people  bt rge way ny salad was good as was my wifes fish sandwich  fries were a bit on the cold side but passable  we were not in the store at rush it was 200 , well it may be a brand new store but it still suffers from the same problem as most fast food stores  bad help . i went with my wife and she ordered by number  no problem  i ordered a southwest salad  was asked

i like mcdonalds every once in awhile there i said it never come to this mcdonalds if youre hungry in a good mood or expect to be met with kindness our order was simple but we had to repeat it multiple times in response to whaaa coming from the order box then when the voice from the box repeated our order it was wrong then when we went to the pay window they asked if our order was correct and it absolutely was not then when we went to the food window we asked for ketchup and were told it was in the bag we dug in found no ketchup but a ton of salt packets luckily my boyfriend is a ketchup hoarder so we had a bunch of little packets on hand overall the debacle started off comically difficult and ended up thisappointing and a bit enraging mostly i was mad because we were lied to the ketchup was a lie now i cannot lie i will probably be back because my expectations for mcds are not too high and i like french fries, i like mcdonalds every once in awhile there i said it never come to this mcdonald's if youre hungry in a good mood or expect to be met with kindness our order was simple but we had to repeat it multiple times
this review is for the shamrock shake onlyit is brighter green than i remember an extremely unnatural shade of green that does not occur normally in nature for as unnatural the color is the flavor is just as fake i do not think there is any actual mint or dairy in these things i think they are petroluembaseddoes it taste different than it used to definitely a few years ago mcds did the unthinkable they ditched their old shake recipes for a new fastercheapereasier shake system basically a neutral vanilla shake comes out and different flavored syrups are mixed in at the last minute the result is a subpar product syrupy and too sweet it is not even mixed when it comes out it is like those thousandflavor ice cream joints that do the flavor syrups yukis the shamrock shake thisgusting yesdo i kind of love it yesthe shakes do not taste too horribly different they are similar enough to the old recipe to still be ok in my book do i feel dirty for eating one yesdo i now want to vomit yeswould i recommend the shamrock shake to the casual observer totally, A few years ago mcds ditched their old shake recipes for a new fastercheapereasier shake system . The result is a subpar product syrupy and too sweet it is not even mixed when it comes out .

when i think of mcdonalds i generally think of a pretty tightly ran ship and expediencysomething is horribly wrong with this mcdonalds severely long wait times at the drive thru a couple weeks ago they werent even taking orders via the intercom you literally had to wait your turn to get to the 2nd window before placing your order then they had you wait right there at the window until they fulfilled the order do you know what this does to business cars were driving off without completing their ordersi just now attempted to go through just for a coffee few cars in line but againloooonnnng wait time i finally got to the intercom and before i could even place my coffee order the woman blurts out that they do not currently have any friesseriously this is flippin mcdonaldsi placed my coffee order then started the long wait after a few minutes and no movement of the cars ahead i pulled on out of there and went across the street to the whopper king i do believe from what i have seen going on there over the past couple of months that unless there is a corporate interventionand soonthis place is a sinking ship with no life boats, Something is horribly wrong with this mcdonalds drive thru drive thru .

taking the fast out of fast foodthe upside once in a while we all eat at mcdonalds this one happens to be very clean and nearly nice on the inside howeverthe downside i have gone to this location several times over the past two years each time i went through the drivethrough and had to endure a wait of over 10 minutes i literally waited 15 minutes in line on two different ocassions so just today when i visited i thought hmm i will be smart this time i will go inside to beat the line drivethrough line wrapping around the building well i should have known better inside the line snaked to the door just two feet from where i entered the restaurant they had one woman on the register and she was moving at a snails pacei waited for a full 10 minutes  yes i am an idiot  and still had not even gotten to place my order in fact there were still five people in front of me frustrated and hating myself for giving this place yet another shot i left without food and vowed never to returnthe sumitup i really do not like mcdonalds that much but i do think that they seem pretty wellrun overall however this particular location is an anomoly it is just downright horrid in it is customer service and nobody  i mean nobody  should ever stop here for fast food this place is terrible, This particular location is an anomoly it is just downright horrid in it is customer service and nobody  should ever stop here for fast food this place is terrible .

they recently gave this location a renovation and updated it it looks really nice and now has an indoor play area for the kiddos it is super clean inside at least when i went though we actually had to ask someone where the trashcan was since it was hidden around a corner ketchup thispenser was broken and they gave me sweet and sour sauce instead of sweet chili like i asked now i usually do not review fast food since it is pretty much the same no matter where you go but this is the location closest to my house and i can honestly say i rarely ever go because of one thingthey are sloowwwwww in the drive through expect to wait around 10 minutes i even had two people behind me decide to leave after they had ordered and i was not the one holding up the line i ordered a spicy mcchicken and nuggets i even considered if going inside would have been faster bottom line this is not the place to go if you want fast, They recently gave this location a renovation and updated it it looks really nice and now has an indoor play area for the kiddos it is super clean inside at least when i went though we actually had to ask someone where the trashcan

this review is based on the poor service i received in the drive thru last night i have nothing to say about the food because it is mcdonalds i had a horrible headache and a long drive back from the woodlands so i just decided to swing through the drive thru to grab some food hoping it would help my headache there were two cars in front of me when i pulled into the line one car was at the pick up window the other was at the intercom to order it did not take long for the car in front of me to order when it was my turn i literally sat there for 3 minutes without anyone acknowledging me usually if the employees are slow they will at least say hello and then ask for a moment to help other customers i was about to yell into the intercom to make sure they were in fact open people were pulling up behind me and i was losing my patience finally some lady came on the intercom and said what can i get you as if they were the ones waiting on me to decide i could hear a lot of noise in the background sounded chaotic i asked for a grilled chicken wrap she responded with we do not have grilled meat wait yeah ok grilled what else then i asked for sprite were out of sprite ok please give me unsweet ice tea ok sweet tea at that point my headache was so bad i did not even try to ask for the frickin unsweet tea then she told me to drive forward without telling me a total as i am waiting to pay and get my food i see at least two cars leave the drive thru line because they are fed up with the poor service when i got to the window the lady even made a comment about it ooooh look at all those cars leaving i am sorry but if you are aware that you are losing customers maybe you should step it up a little bit and get your shit together so you do not lose customers she could not have cared less it was patheticluckily i do not live in that area so i am hoping to never have to experience such slow horrible service in a drive thru this was by far one of the worst experiences i have ever had, this review is based on the poor service i received in the drive thru last night . i had a horrible headache and a long drive back from the woodlands so i decided to swing through the drive through to grab some food hoping it would

this location is about average as far as mcdonalds goes their playground tends to be closed often due to broken equipment or most recently broken doors leading to the playground so if youre planning on taking a group of young children you might want to check ahead of time to make sure the playground is available i do like the fact that it is one of the few in the area that still have an outdoor playground but the lack of cover for outdoor tables makes eating outdoors rather unpleasant all in all it is okay and the convenient location in the neighborhood makes it a regular stop unfortunately some of the employees are more interested in chatting with one another than serving customers and if you have a group of people paying separately but eating together there is an annoying tendency to refuse to take your orders at the same time  meaning the first persons food is cold by the time the last person is servededit i ate at spicy mcchicken sandwich from the value menu around 8pm on 51709 and within hours was doubled over with food poisoning i cannot say that it came from the sandwich or course but i can provide this information and let others draw their own logical conclusions, The location is about average as far as mcdonalds goes . Some of the employees are more interested in chatting with one another than serving customers . The lack of cover for outdoor tables makes eating outdoors rather unpleasant .

100 worst mcdonalds on the planet we have given them chance after chance and i just cant do it anymore our order is never right you better check your order including inside your burger before you even walk away from the counter or leave the drive thru during one visit they messed up my husbands burger three times within 5 minutes i dont understand how hard it is to slap a piece of fake meat onto a bun and throw the correct condiments onunless you cant read the ticket which honestly wouldnt be surprising there is one employee who every time we go just happens to take a break sit in a chair near to us and scream yell bitch and cuss to her hearts content on her cell phone i dont care if your on a break you still represent your workplace because you are still wearing the uniform and sitting in the lobby after the fourth time in a row of seeing this we decided we would never return there are a few other locations nearby i suggest you choose them instead, 100 worst mcdonalds on the planet we have given them chance after chance and i just cant do it anymore .

i have never seen any reason to add a review to a mcdonalds who checks a review on fast food prior to walking in the door however this mcdonalds has consistently underdelivered and i am honestly beyond frustrated at this pointi moved to an apartment complex near this location and started out visiting a few times a week out of convenience after my first 3 or 4 visits i started to realize that it would be much more likely that i would win the mcdonalds monopoly game than receive the basic accommodations offered by most mcds i have watched a manager get into a verbal altercation with customers admittedly an unruly customer sweet tea has been made available less than 1in 4 visits tables are rarely cleaned during peak hours the ice machine tends to run more like a water fountain and most importantly  the guest service is terrible i am largely content with mcdonalds at large but this is not like any mcdonalds experience youll ever see elsewhere the receipts do not come with a tell us how were doing number so i made my concerns available to corporate after having to research the number on my own after my call to corporate the local management team reached out to me they offered a free meal card for my next visit but never actually delivered it surprise i can only hope that this is not the future of the company do not enter these doors, i have never seen any reason to add a review to a mcdonalds who checks a review on fast food prior to walking in the door . i have watched a manager get into a verbal altercation with customers . tables are rarely cleaned during

whenever i travel alone i tend to focus on trying places i would never see at home but whenever i travel with others which is often there is almost always someone who cannot stomach the idea of eating something that is not familiar to them so hence i find myself at mickey ds this one out of terminal b is especially atrocious even for the mediocre benchmarks of mcdonalds nationwide i eventually fled to the adjacent panchito yelpcombizpanchitosmao_ which was equally terriblethe service at mcdonalds is never particularly outstanding but when it is it is especially worth noting i just wish this place had it the woman at the register was painfully slow which on airport time can be excruciating after paying the demons of airport overpricing we continued to wait and wait  to the point where i had to ask if our food was ever coming outoh the fryers broken thanks for telling me that awhile ago when i ordered the stuff in the first place wait there are some nuggets  fries that are already made that does not sound particularly appetizing either but who am i to complain this is fast food after allin the interest of saving time we grab the sack of soggy french fries and crazy hard nuggets while i sip on a deflated coke how does one screw up a soft drink it still managed to happen here and though i am not one to shy away from complaining it was already too late all of these thiscoveries were made while in our plane curses, The service at mcdonalds is never particularly outstanding but when it is it is especially worth noting i just wish this place had it the woman at the register was painfully slow which on airport time can be excruciating after paying the demons of airport

this mcdonalds needs a security guard because the weird homeless people corner you and the begging starts the shock of them sneaking around the corner is too much that you immediately do not hear what they say so you just say no and it is not dirty smelly bums these are capable people who can go get a damn job and pay their way this mcdonalds is just weirdi only come here because my boyfriend like to make a late night run after work the drive thru people do not speak english and your order is always wrong i do not know why they do not take debit or credit card after a certain time they always ask for cash i find it odd that is all i am saying some of the people i do not trust they look shady as hellthis mcdonalds is so odd, this mcdonalds needs a security guard because the weird homeless people corner you and the shock of them sneaking around the corner is too much that you immediately do not hear what they say so you just say no .

many many late night munchies have been satisfied at this establishment other people complain about how they sometimes do not have everything in stock i have only run into that situation 1 or 2 times since i am not that picky when it comes to fast food beggers cannot be choosers imo i usually order a simple burger so they are bound to have that in stock my friend always gets salads so sometimes they are out of the kind he usually gets but again that has happened like 1 or 2 times at mostas for the food even late at night the food is served hot so i am definitely satisfied there inside is just like any other mcdonalds with an indoor playpen for kiddies overall i have not had any bad experiences with this place other than the occasional homeless person walking up to your car asking for money when youre sitting in the drivethru at 2 am but that has nothing to do with mcdonalds you can run into homeless people anywhere, Inside is just like any other mcdonalds with an indoor playpen for kiddies . Overall i have not had any bad experiences with this place other than the occasional homeless person walking up to your car .
this is the mcdonalds that my friends and i always go to since it is the closest to our apartment but at the same time it is definitely the worst one i have ever been toone plus is that their drivethru is open 24 hours but sadly the later at night you go the more often your choices are limited for example one day we were craving their vanilla cone but they said that their ice cream machine was off already so they could not make it okay whats the point of staying open 24 hours if you cannot even give the customers the food they wantthe other day i had a pretty bad dinein experience the lady behind the counter charged extra for big mac sauce on the mcdouble which i have never experienced before usually going through drivethru they never charge extra for a mcdouble wo the ketchup w big mac sauce and shredded lettuce aka a big mac but cheaper my boyfriend and i were pretty shocked when she told us we had to pay extra for the sauce and she claimed that they always do this which they really never dothen this same lady proceeded to close the cash register before giving me my change she told me to wait on the side so she can give it to me after she opens it for the next customer so i patiently waited and then she closed the cash register again after the next customer and totally forgot to give me my change so i had to remind her again to which she just laughed and semiapologized and then finally gave me my change after like a decade of waiting argh worst mcdonalds worker ever completely rude and horrible customer service skills i totally agree with my boyfriend who said this mcdonalds is very poorly managed he even wrote a complaint to them a while back but they never responded we love to see you smile i beg to differ, This is the mcdonalds that my friends and i always go to since it is the closest to our apartment but at the same time it is definitely the worst one i have ever been to . The drivethru is open 24 hours
so incredibly peeved i went to the drivethru to grab a quick lunch before i went into the office i bought 2 cheeseburgers and when i got to my office i found there was only one cheeseburger this was supposed to be my lunch the sticker on the bag that says double checked for accuracy is just laughing at me right now either they did not double check it or they do not know how to count i do not understand the satisfaction of scamming 99 cents from customers but whatever makes you sleep at night i guessthe only reason i ever go to this mcdonalds is because it is close to usc and close to my apartment i really thislike this mcdonalds really really thislikeoh and you will almost always get homelesshobos loitering outside asking you for money, So incredibly peeved i went to the drivethru to grab a quick lunch before i went into the office i bought 2 cheeseburgers and when i got to my office i found there was only one cheeseburger .

i star for the food my drivethru experience at 940ish pm 120814 was 4 just because youre a fast food place that does not mean you do not greet customers a hello good evening or sorry for the wait something that lets me feel a lil better for spending my hard earned cash at this establishment anyone that works retail knows how much customer sevice is pushed management at this mcdonalds should consider retraining  teach these employees the basics working with the public being a cashier is not easy you deal with unsavory people with crappier attitudes sometimes but you still want your customers to leave happier not upset, i star for the food my drivethru experience at 940ish pm 120814 was 4 .

mcdonalds is usually very prompt with servicing your orders however it took about 20 minutes to go through the drivethru line tonight at 8pm it should not take 20 minutes to get fast food my friend and i ordered fries a double cheeseburger and a mcdouble definitely one of the slowest drive thrus i have experienced but perhaps it was just an off day for them this mcdonalds is also very close to downtown highland park so you can grab a bite to eat at mcdonalds and then head to the york or hermosillo down the road for some drinksit is located in a quiet neighborhood with not a whole lot of traffic cannot complain about that, It took about 20 minutes to go through the drivethru line tonight at 8pm .

the service was pretty bad we ordered our food normally and we wondered why we were waiting so long so when we checked on it they took our receipt and the time was apparently dated wrong and they accused of us lying when we werent they said they would get us our food and when we went back again they asked us again if we wanted the money or food so we ended up just leaving i would not be coming back to this mcdonalds again, the service was pretty bad we ordered our food normally and we wondered why we were waiting so long so when we checked on it they took our receipt and the time was apparently dated wrong .

not sure whether to laugh or cry about the weirdo slightly traumatizing experience late night at this drive thru i felt like i was on the set of walking dead but these zombies were a little less predictable by the time we got to the pay window and waited for our food two slow shady bums started to turn into a swarm as we waited for our food two turned to four bums walking around our car just staring at us trying to talk to us and getting up close to our windows they wouldnt leave then across the street more zombies appeared out of nowhere including zombies on bikes who too stopped to stare by far the strangest sht i have ever seen i guess this is what you get for being by skid row for some fries i lived to tell the tale but i was not so sure wtf was going down while i was there makes for a funny story but def not trying my luck or going back there ever again calling this a ghetto mcdonalds is an understatement seriously wtf was that go experience it for yourself if you get out alive atleast the food is pretty damn tasty oh and not sure why drive thru was cash only, Two shady shady bums started to turn into a swarm as we waited for our food two turned to four bums walking around our car just staring at us trying to talk to us .

this is my third review of mcdonalds across three different cities yelp i hope youre paying attention because if this veritable thisplay of fast food prowess is not enough to grant me elite status i just do not know what isbecause it is mcdonalds and everyone knows that mcdonalds serves the most amazing flashfrozen food in the world i employ a different rating system where every one i go to starts at 5 stars i take off stars according to my experiences therelet us begin for this location5 stars it is mcdonalds for chrissake i do not need to justify this4 stars i had to knock it down one star because they ran out of cheeseburgers once at like 200am when they first told me it did not even register in my brain i ordered two cheeseburgers and the lady replied sorry we do not have cheeseburgers right now all i could say was no just a regular one not a mcdouble she had to repeat it again and i was so flabbergasted that i sat silently in the drivethru window as my world was crashing around me four hours later i was able to collect my thoughts and order a filetofish3 stars there is a constant ring of transients that surround this place late at night they come up to you when youre pulling up to the window they do not even ask for food they try and give you money to buy stuff for them because presumably you cannot ride a shopping cart into the drivethru one time i was feeling nice and bought a lady a coffee but then she proceeded to yell at me as i was driving away because i only got her 10 sugar packets instead of the 50 million that she requested on the plus side the establishment does a reasonably good job of keeping them out after hours so now i know where to board myself up during a zombie apocalypse2 stars one time they questioned me when i ordered 80 nuggets did i stutter it is 300am on a saturday night you should be questioning the people who get a 6 piece 100 is pretty standard these days with two of every sauce including some that do not exist zestychipotlethai peanut butter i do not want to wake up on sunday morning unless there is halfeaten nuggets under my pillow, This is my third review of mcdonalds across three different cities yelp i hope youre paying attention because if this veritable thisplay of fast food prowess is not enough to grant me elite status i just do not know what

not to madly contradict what others are saying but in fairness the location is in an industrial part of downtown la in the produce market area at night the area is pretty desolate until the early morning hours of around 3 or 4 in the morning when the area comes alive now i will admit that the proximity to the greyhound station is not attracting the typical mcdonalds crowd and i expect they sell more dollar menu items than they do happy meals and it wouldnt be my first choice ordinarily but the other mcdonalds at olympic and central was closed due to remodeling on a night i was really craving some fries on the way home so i put on my bold face the one that says do not ask me st and figured i would tough it out at alameda and 7th it was around 900pm on a weeknightwhen i pulled in i noticed how brightly lit it was and while there seemed to be a few cars in the drive thru none of them looked like they were waiting for very long seeing the same type of buzz inside i decided to go inside and walk up to the counterwhen i got inside i can only guess someone there reads yelp reviews it was ridiculously clean they seemed to have adequate staff on hand and they moved very efficiently the counter staff was very friendly the food came fast and was hotnow naturally this should not be a guarantee for all future visits but it was a good experience and shows what can be done as such my star ratings reflect the service and the cleanliness because it is been there so long i would not ding them for the location or the neighborhood, The location is in an industrial part of downtown la in the produce market area at night .

foodit is a mcdonalds they are all the same food wise right i mean they have to be mac snack wrap those clever bastards not even good but fun to say out loud when ordering locationthis one probably used to be all bright eyed and bushy tailed with a roller backpack full of ideas anxiously waiting to get off the train at union station after the long trip from headquarters in oak brook il pockets filled with employee schedules and a neatly folded franchise license then it got lost lost into the heart of a thismaying darkness along a transient corridor known as alameda its employee of the month dreams fading against the howling winds of reality in la but with its golden arches still standing as a beacon for those hungrystaffi did not think mcdonalds could possibly produce employees this professionally hardened no the staff here have to be contractors hired guns soldiers of fortune blackwater mercenaries warriors jaded after years of serving tours in suburbia and south central they are a high speed low drag group geared up everyday to get our food hot and fast while defending their outpost from the raiding bands of scavengers send this icy eyed crew into afghanistan and watch the new york times and amnesty internationals front covers fill with pictures of crying children and burning villages this is the closest mcds to my place downtown so eff it yes the locals can be annoying as the other reviewers have stated i am cautious to say that they are harmless because i cannot guarantee that eating inside was probably one the most colorful experiences and worst mistakes i ever made in my life and i will leave it at that the drive thru is not so bad at the window the employees will yell at the locals to leave you alone which often times they will just never get out of the boat when you crave those delicious corn product filled meat patties, The staff here have to be contractors hired guns soldiers of fortune blackwater mercenaries warriors jaded after years of serving tours in suburbia and south central .

i do not need to review the food as everyone knows what it is like either way depending on their opinionthis location is one of the biggest i have ever been in and has free wifi however what makes this place special is the vast assortment of fairly crazy people that hole up here i am hardly unsympathetic to the homeless but if youve been here you know what i am talking about try itit is quite an adventure def some regulars that set up camp who are just plain off which can make it uncomfortable sometimes i actually feel a bit sorry for the staff for all the daily crap they must have to endure belligerent customers who are mentally ill and have plenty of free time it must be fairly soulcrushing but most of the workers manage to still be polite, The location is one of the biggest i have ever been in and has free wifi .

the only thing i am going to write about it is the location itself and the service this location is great if you work nearby so you dont have to park behind the building and there is a lot of seating however it is always crowded and some of the people who are there seem a little suspect the workers quite efficient i imagine that with the sort of crowds they get they are pretty fast at getting your food out pretty quickly just order and they will take your name down and then youll get your food within 5 minutes due to the myriad type of characters that are inside i tend to just pick up my food and head back to eat in my office, The location is great if you work nearby so you dont have to park behind the building and there is a lot of seating .

the only thing that saved this fast food restaurant from receiving two stars from me is their table availability and sizeenvironment  this mcdonalds has a big table for a group of 12 people if i remember it correctly the big letdown is the store policy of no refills on drinks allowed and loitering is not allowed  only maximum of 30 minutesfood  the quality in terms of newly cooked is dependent on the time of visit i visit in the mornings so their regular allday menu is not sitting in the heating trayscabinetscrewservers same as other mcdonalds, The only thing that saved this fast food restaurant from receiving two stars is their table availability and size .

located on the border of the west and greenwich village this mcdonalds restaurant which according to wikipedia is a part of the worlds largest chain of hamburger fast food restaurants is in a prime locationwhile the decor is a little dated it reflects the some of the architecture and older buildings in the village there is also a great hanging mural of basketball players located above the register and can be better viewed while dining on the second floor of the establishment the art most likely drew inspiration from the west 4th street courts located across from the restaurant paying homage to the localsinstead of order from a waiter you order individually through the designated cash registers while this may seem like more work it does save you some extra cash and also lets you customize your order directly without having to go through another person the menu itself has it is staples the big mac  filetofish mcnuggets and of course the french fries which are all bargains for the amount of food you receive when compared to other restaurants there is also an ever changing rotation of new sandwich wraps salads and other specialty items all of which have the same mcdonalds qualitythis past visit i ordered a mcdouble a large french fires and a 4 piece mcnuggets the food was ready for me in under five minutes a time almost unheard of at other restaurants i took a seat at the upstairs section and started with the mcdouble the mcdouble included two cooked beef patties cheese pickles ketchup and chopped onions very satisfying for under 2 dollars i then switched between the hot crispy french fries and the mcnuggets small deep fried pieces of chicken which i dipped in ketchup and their very tasty honey mustard sauce all in all i was very full and content with my meal all of which cost me under 10 at any other local restaurant just a burger and fries would have run me more than 10 and most likely closer to 15although the food may not be on par quality wise with other nearby eateries minetta tavern 100 acres and market table essentially you are getting a full meal at nearly half the price and a quarter of the time i would highly recommend this mcdonalds and look forward to visiting their other locations, Located on the border of the west and greenwich village this mcdonalds restaurant is a part of the worlds largest chain of hamburger fast food restaurants .

i do not normally rush to post on yelp no matter what the experience is but my time at mcdonalds was one for the ages and even for mcdonalds standardsi first walk in and there is a group of 5 or 6 employees huddled in the front corner bsing with the manager about some check drama with the overnight staffit all seemed pretty pointless mundane and something that should not be thiscussed with other employees let alone with customers in ear shotbut that is just meso the girl in front of me finishes ordering and moves to the sidenow naturally i was assuming that it was my turn to orderat first i did not think that she saw me even though i was clearly in front of her but i did not think she could be that denseso i began to orderguess what she did not see meshe was too wrapped up in the aforementioned payroll conversationi was finally able to put my order in after she put her two cents in with her coworkers she almost forgot the fries that i ordered but i was able to catch her in timeso now i waitand wait and waitnow everyone that is working is huddled in the corner talking about the payroll dramawhen another customer walks inshe catches him pretty quickly this time and says welcome to mcdonalds do not worry this service does not lastshe then interrupts his order to ask a question about two of her female coworkers that came into pickup their paychecksafter she makes her comment she let us the customer to proceeduntilwait for itwait for ither phone rings and she proceeds to have a conversation before putting her child on hold to take the rest of the ordernow while i am waiting for over 6 minutesi get to hear the coworkers cursing in spanish bsing with each other about god knows whatlearning that there is only diet soda and basically it is not her problem and she does not care to elaborate on why there is only diet sodashe does not know the menuwhen i finally get my food i open the bag and while they had my order right my medium fries were only filled half way and spilled all over the bag so now you can see why i had to yelp about this right away because i would have completely missed some of these crucial points of service expectations, i do not normally rush to post on yelp no matter what the experience is but my time at mcdonalds was one for the ages and even for mcdonald's standards .

i used to come here for lunch a lot when i worked in the area last year now it is just a random pitstop when i am running by home depot or bloomies their cash register system is a hot mess they have 6ish registers all in a row and because of the busy location they almost always have all of them active but here are the problems1 no one knows whether to stand in 1 big line or 6 smaller lines it ends up just being a big blob of people2 there is nowhere for people to easily pick up their food once it is been ordered and paid for there is no pick up here counter they just bellow out order numbers and it is up to you to fight your way back through the line to claim your order god help anyone who finds their order wrongotherwise it is just another mcdonalds they finally ditched their longbroken escalator in favor of a traditional staircase so that is a plus as with every mcdonalds location enter with low expectations and youll be fine, i used to come here for lunch a lot when i worked in the area last year now it is just a random pitstop when i am running by home depot or bloomies .

allow me to preface this review by saying that i have never actually purchased anything from this mcdonalds maybe someday i will because i work nearby in the lipstick building but not yetto tell the truth there really is not any reason to buy food from this mcdonalds east midtown is like ground zero for bombass gyro guys including the excellent one on the southeast corner of 54th and 3rd and the inimitable rafiqi on 50th or so and 3rd any of these carts will be cheaper than mcdonalds since youre definitely going to pay manhattan prices at this location the dollar menu is certainly anemic there is also an assortment of good sandwich and pizza places around hereso why am i reviewing this mcdonalds you might ask it is simple 3rd avenue faces a lack of good places to sit and eat especially on a hot day and if you are wearing clothes that you do not want to risk getting gyro sauce on if you need somewhere to sit and eat regardless of where you purchased your food this mcdonalds is the place to go they have excellent air conditioning a supply of good napkins clean tables and a nice view of the street i can attest to the fact that the staff will not roust you from your seat even if you are blatantly not eating mcdonalds i have eaten gyrossandwichespizza in this location several times and it has been an excellent place to eat on each occasion, east midtown is like ground zero for bombass gyro guys including the excellent one on the southeast corner of 54th and 3rd and the inimitable rafiqi on 50th or so and 3th .

i would say this is the worst mcdonalds i have ever been to why because on the few times that i actually eat mcdonalds i choose fastfood due to being in a rush therefore it should not take close to 20 minutes to get a simple burger and fries they always hand back everyones food before mine i dont know maybe they do this to pretty girls because it always happens to me here the staff here are rude and talk way to much stop chatting and make my food that is all, i would say this is the worst mcdonalds i have ever been to why because on the few times that i actually eat fastfood i choose fastfood due to being in a rush therefore it should not take close to 20 minutes to

this review is about 2 thingsfirst my local mcdonalds and the diligent and familiar employees there and second the return of the mcrib sandwichi never tasted a mcrib previously but ever since i had seen that king of queens episode that alluded that kevin james drove all the way to canada because he heard they still had the mcrib sandwich therei have been waiting for my opportunitytoday that need was satisfiedit is worth a shot no surprises no real fat i am sure they pulverize that a million times over and blend it in no bones  seriously it was decent the bbq sauce is a little better than mass heinz 57 style and not bad with a mixture of onions smattered on there at 325 including tax this was a much better deal than my breakfast today at quadruple the price now onto the staff i have grown to understand the flow of this placesometimes they get their signals crossed but in general if watch the counter it does not matter where you stand just zoom up into that line where the person is waving drop your order and step to the side there is nothing else you can do to speed things up this mostly female staff from probably the same country of origin and maybe same neighborhood work well together in their own way 8 times out of 10 you will be out of there in under 5 mins 10 mins topssignedribby mcribberson, The mcrib sandwich was a much better deal than my breakfast today at quadruple the price . The bbq sauce is a little better than mass heinz 57 style and not bad with a mixture of onions smattered on there
really really bad customer servicei have very very very low expectations from customer service but the thing with their employees at this location seriously there was this girl who asked for my order by nodding her headwhile resting her chin on the register we took 2 seconds to decide and she growl at us saying what do you want in a very thugish tone not cool," really really bad customer service, i. have very very very low expectations from customer service .

mcdonalds is mcdonalds what can i say i almost feel weird reviewing a fast food chain since they are all consistently the samei visit this particular mcdonalds branch often not for their food but for their 99 cent fee atm and sometime to use their restroom which is very convenient if you are in the area i rarely eat mcdonalds but recommend this branch if you are in the area and in need of restroom and 99 cent fee atm which both are also available in all other mcdonald branches as well lol, The 99 cent fee atm atm is available in all other mcdonalds branches .

this mcdonalds blows and that is relative to my already low initial expectations if i order something pay for it you do not have it and i get something cheaper instead  then you owe me some money back instead i got a whole bunch of attitude like i was really interrupting something much more important the cashier had to do and then had to debate whether i was owed any money back at all it sure makes it hard to believe that 15 per hour is justified, this mcdonalds blows and that is relative to my already low initial expectations .

i am not sure how else to put this there are a few homeless people who ask for money at the entrance and inside the seating area that is reason enough to avoid this placeit can be pretty thisorganized but chances are if youre here youre fully aware of what youre getting yourself intoweird bit they do not have ketchup thispensers in the seating areabut would not give you any ketchup packets without being asked that is kind of like giving me a burger and fries to go but without a bag, There are a few homeless people who ask for money at the entrance and inside the seating area that is reason enough to avoid this place .

it is almost a year since the first reviewer wrote how rude the staff at this mcdonalds is i regret to say that nothing has changed in fact it is gotten worse as someone on foursquare commented be prepared to wait on line for a long time i waited for 10 minutes and the line never moved i have never had such slow service at any mcdonalds and i have never had such slow service in manhattan i never thought i would face this at a mcdonalds in manhattan when a new line opened up the server deliberately ignored me and called out in spanish to a man who had been waiting in another line less than one minute avoiding eye contact with me the whole time i got on line behind him she chitchatted with him and then went and got his food herself instead of letting the staff in the back do it another 5 minutes by the time i got to the front of the line no welcome not even a smile for me i ordered my breakfast she took my money and then proceeded to take the next two ordersthis time of course having the staff which themselves were working at a snails pace get my food she handed me the bag with no receipt and no thank you i thought to complain to the manager and then i looked at the nameplate of the person serving me she was the manager i hardly ever have had a bad experience at mcdonalds but i guess there is a first for everything from now on i am getting my big mac fix at penn station or any of the other locations other than this thisaster at 28th and 6th just not this one at least until i take some spanish lessons which seems to be the prerequisite to be treated like a human being, It is almost a year since the first reviewer wrote how rude the staff at this mcdonalds is . i regret to say that nothing has changed in fact it is gotten worse as someone on foursquare commented .
welcome it became patently obvious within one minute of entering this particular mcdonalds that they have a different way of approaching the customer maybe it comes from the owner but welcome not may i take your order or hello or go ahead with your order when you are ready just welcome then nothing elseso after being welcomed aloud many times before actually getting my turn to indulge in a childhood treat i finally made it to the front of the line really it was raining out i did not have an umbrella and this was the closest place to where i was working today socashier welcomeme  silencecashier welcomeme  places ordercashier  no movement whatsoeverme  silencefinally she slaps a key and it is in she was actually friendly but this dynamic was so awkward that i felt like i had been away from mcdonalds too long and somehow lost a part of the lingo between fast food cashier and customerservice was fast there are good mcdonalds and bad mcdonalds and this one was just in the middle the burger was warm not hot but tasted fine the coke was not sharp and bubbly and the fries were a little overdone it is mcdonalds so there are no expectations but this one just hit the middle, Burger was warm not hot but tasted fine and tasted fine .

first of allthis location takes forever i came in for a simple iced coffee asked for a splash of cream and no sugarcashier looked at me like i had 3 heads did not realize that was such a diva request then the girl making the coffee had to double check what i was asking forseriously and these workers think they deserve more  sadly i like mcdonalds coffee way better than starbucksbut a simple request is asking them for too much good coffee horrible service a plain iced coffee should not take 20 minutes especially when there are only 2 people ahead of you oh and i forgot to mention my splash of cream looks like they dumped the whole damn bottle in therelooks more like a splash of coffee see pic, A simple request is asking them for too much good coffee and horrible service .

it is mcdonalds same tasty menu and options the location is convenient as it is located right by the train in case you emerge from the space below with cheeseburgers on your mind i do like the computer thisplay system that allows you to see when your order is ready and something about the layout seemed newer than other mcdonalds but maybe i was just excited because i was having a killer craving, The location is convenient as it is located right by the train in case you emerge from the space below with cheeseburgers on your mind .
other than the fact that its super conveniently located right outside of 28th street station 6 on park avenue and that it has more electric outlets than your average coffeeshop offerings are the same crappy low class food youll find at any mcdonalds across the nation i like their 1 coffee and sweet teas thoughone thing that is annoying is the latino looking manager hunting people down for chilling or loitering around the tables but for those of us who bought something leave us the fuck alone and chill out and stop giving that certain look like were some jobless thugs or something some of us want to unwind after a 15 hour work shift with some coffee while charging our phones for gods sakei saw a shady black yes i emphasize race because that is keeping it mad fucking real just like you want it homies drinking beer out of a brown bag and loitering around and the manager did not do anything que idiota cabron que sos ni verga te pareces manager jodido lol, The latino looking manager hunting people down for chilling or loitering around the tables but for those of us who bought something leave us the fuck alone and chill out .
with the amount of time it takes to get your order here it is hard to call this fast food definitely one of the worst run mcdonalds i have ever seen no one wants to work between the lackadaisical cashiers to the employees just standing around instead of preparing food and filling drink orders this place is a mess then add the dozens of homeless people in here and you really just want a shower when you get out i say this yet still go back at least twice a month it is downstairs from my office and right off the 6 train ok another redeeming quality is the hash brown which is perfectly cooked  crispy on the outside and soft on the inside word of advice listen very closely to the numbers when they call them out and steer clear of the bathrooms do not even stand near them, It is one of the worst run mcdonalds i have ever seen no one wants to work between the lackadaisical cashiers to the employees just standing around instead of preparing food and filling drink orders this place is a mess .

it feels silly to write a review for a fast food establishment but i am writing this only to jog my memory of what happened earlier this week i walked in with the intention of grabbing a quick postbeer snack with a buddy we sat down with something like 20 chicken nuggets gross i know and started eating away some few minutes later we hear a commotion towards the entrance i turn around and see what appears to be the dirtiest looking homeless man with long grey hair and beard and dirt stained jacket with holes in his shoes the manager happened to notice him immediately and tried to escort him out one thing led to another and this guy started going off on one of the most hatefueled rants i have ever heard surprisingly he was quite eloquent and made references to movies pop culture and some literary classics objectively speaking i imagined this 64ish looking man was at one point quite educated and maybe even handsome i was too busy observing the scene to actually record anything for youtube at first he directed his hatred towards the manager and then went into a long address to everyone in the store long story short there is a revolution coming and we are illprepared we are leading our lives in ignorance and before we know it the tides will shift men like him are congregating and amassing technology and weapons beyond our knowledge lol ok at this point he gestured pulling out a weapon and shooting everyone at this point the manager forcibly escorted him out against his restraint a few moments later he ran back in and pulled out an imaginary grenade tossed it in the store and ran back outside i was just trying to enjoy my chicken nuggets what the hellother than that this location is actually quite nice compare to most of the others, A homeless man started going off on one of the most hatefueled rants i have ever heard . He was quite eloquent and made references to movies pop culture and some literary classics . The manager forcibly escorted him out against his restraint
i admit i am guilty and came here a few times when i had a fix for a mcrib sandwich or a 6 piece chicken mc nuggets service is just ok depends on what time of day and how crowded the place is  it is not as efficient as other mcdonalds in midtown but its not the worst either  it is almost impossible to find seating during lunch time though  always packed so better to take your food to go, Service is just ok depends on what time of day and how crowded the place is .

nothing special just another mcdonalds in the city the food is consistent but the service may vary depending on when you go i experienced a strung out cashier during one lunch shift might have been the poor girls first day on the job but she completely messed up my order i think she gave me everything on the menu except for the food that i did order lol, The food is consistent but the service may vary depending on when you go .

i have eaten at nougatine and abc kitchen numerous times but i have to admit that i keep coming back to this fine institution for a great meal that puts jgvs work to shame the french fries are an example of potatoes that have been prepared in a form that may be legitimately considered a work of art the gentle texture and crisp of the fries are testament to the corporations impeccable execution of deep frying and the training that the personnel have undergone to achieve this perfection across the franchise is very much laudable my experience with the beef has been nothing short of flawless as i had requested the patty in my burger was prepared to a mediumrare and the subtle cheese and softlygrated onions danced with the rich ketchup and mustard on my tongue as i tasted thick and quality processed meat between two pieces of toasted and warm buns the acidity of the salted fries and that of the burger did not balance quite as i liked it though i was very much satisfied anyway i have to say that short of makeup sex i have had no better experience in my 20s to finish my threecourse the apple pies were magnificent the texture of the apples led me to believe that they were in fact potatoes but i must commend mcdonalds for aptly managing their resources and overhead by taking advantage of economies of scale in purchasing only mass quantities of one ingredient as opposed to diversifying their portfolio this may lead to higher margins in that the franchises would be able to provide more products in their menu eg genuine apple smoothies or appleinfused panacotta but would ultimately lead to higher operating costs in any case the dessert was very much satisfyingthough i paid only 600 for this meal i must have gained the delight of a 6000 meal cheers to an amazing institution for providing a meal aptly suited for all social castes, i have eaten at nougatine and abc kitchen numerous times but i have to admit that i keep coming back to this fine institution for a great meal that puts jgvs work to shame .

i realize mcdonalds is meant to be fast food but to call this one particular location fast food is an oxymoron unless waiting 30 minutes to get your items and half the time they are incorrect can pass as fast food now i do not know why my friend keeps insisting on stopping here for a drink it would be faster to stop at walgreens get out of the car get a bottle of coke pay and get back in the car to drive off i believe the addition of a second drivethru lane has created a bigger problem this is causing more congestion as the one right lane blocks people who have ordered in the left lane from being able to advance and join the main paying lane which forces both lanes to immediately merge especially if the ones in the right lane tailgate and would not let you in even though you placed your order before them which would imply your order would come up first you can easily sit in that left lane for 10 minutes while the people behind you are helpless and honk uselessly trying to move up to place their order in addition the cashier has a hard time thispensing the correct items and keeping track of who ordered what we ordered a soda but were handed a bag with burgers and fries which we promptly returned the associate then asked us if we were sure we had not ordered thatuh what seriously way to take responsibility for your mistakes next time this happens well just take the burger and fries and get a drink elsewhere instead of being subjected to this stupid questioning and eternal waits, The addition of a second drivethru lane has created a bigger problem . The one right lane blocks people who have ordered in the left lane from being able to advance and join the main paying lane . The cashier has a hard time

a mcdonaldss with the worst continuing costumer service i have ever experienced on multiple occasions over the course of three years let us just say an average wait for a small fry is 25 minuteslast night at 330 am i pulled up to the drivethru just as a car was reversing out i should have known then that i was warned i continued to pull through but after ten minutes or so no one asked me for my order so i continued on through the drive thru thinking i could order at the next window well actually i sat trapped in the drive thru for over thirty minutes with the line not moving and my car not able to escape the raised drive thru at one point an older male employee came to the first window stood there looked at me and laughed then he turned around and left i assume to continue not doing workafter a waste of 30 minutes the car behind me left and i was able to reverse my way out so i have a few recommendations 1 since your mcdonalds sucks so much please do not barricade drive thru attendees without an escape route 2 learn how to make fast food and 3 fire your entirely incompetent staff youre wasting your moneythis place does not even deserve one star youre better off driving a mile or so to the next mcdonalds, An average wait for a small fry is 25 minutes in a McDonald's drive-thru .

firstly let me address the previous reviews regarding the acceptance of credit cards only at certain times if this happens to you please call mcdonalds and make them aware of this immediately your hard earned cash is being taken by questionable employees in the graveyard shift unless their credit machine is broken it does happen there is no reason you should be required to pay in cash at any mcdonalds regardless of the time this however has never been an issue for mei hate to say this but this mcdonalds is an utter mess god forbid you go during peak hours chances are youll be waiting for a while andor your order will be incorrect this applies to both the drivethru and the dining room the drivethru the good ole drivethru please train your employees to speak clearly into the mouth piece in the headsets english espaiol and kreyi_l ayisyen i have tried all three with no luck establishing a mutual connection hence the probable reason orders are usually incorrect the employee turnover here is pretty obvious either this is one of the restaurants used for training or the previews reviews are correct it is mcdonalds and yes i do frequent this location mostly during nonpeak hours, McDonalds is an utter mess in the drivethru and dining room . If you go during peak hours chances are youll be waiting for a while andor your order will be incorrect .

hate to contradict previous yelpers but i went there because of their reviews and specifically because they said this mcdonalds accepted credit late at night and that they had a lot of items in the menu well guess what only cash at 2am and they only had mcnuggets and a chicken sandwich went for the mcnuggets and they were hard as a stone my guess is that the people who work this shifts in mid week sell food they were suppose to throw away and charge you in cash so they can keep the money otherwise i do not find a logical explanation for this, Yelp reviews said this mcdonalds accepted credit late at night and that they had a lot of items in the menu .

we loooooove junk food and we love mcdonalds but this specific location was a total frustration today we get there and there is about 45 people in the line before us and by the time we order maybe another 56 waiting behind us so we place our order with roberto who is only in charge of the orders and the register he will not do anything else we then proceed to wait for our food we were hungry and in a rush so this was the easiest and yes unhealthy option or so we thought at the time so we wait and wait and then wait some more and in the meantime the 5 people that came in after us got their food and leftit is like hello wtf so hubby complains to roberto who proceeds to explain that he only takes the order nothing elseduh then miguel the manager comes over does not like the fact that hubbys obviously not happy with the situation and tells him it will be another few minuteswefinally our food is ready and guess what it was wrong wtf again hubby goes back to the counter and now he is not nice at all and asks so how long will it take for me to get my correct order to which miguel the manager turns around gets hubbys correct order and exchanges it for the wrong onehuh amazing by the time we get our food we are beyond hungry and in a not so nice mood oh well at least i have to say that miguel came to our table when the rush was over to apologize for the incident and to offer us tomorrows lunch for free but we gratefully declined, There is about 45 people in the line before us and by the time we order maybe another 56 waiting behind us so we place our order with roberto who is only in charge of the orders and the register he will not do anything else

i love this mcdonalds the workers are always friendly and welcome you as you walk into the door the first time i walked into this store i was shocked the store has chandeliers and antiques and art on the walls it looks more like a five star restaurant that a fast food joint the bathrooms even have gold plated fixturesit is still mcdonalds so the food is the same as everywhere else but the employees and atmosphere makes it a pleasant experience, i love this mcdonalds the workers are always friendly and welcome you as you walk into the door .

normally i do not review a chain unless something about that particular location stands out good or badthis location for some reason has the most ridiculous service i have ever encountered it is mcdonalds you say what do you expect not much really but let me tell youencounter 1i ordered 10piece chicken nuggets fries and unsweetened ice tea i got the nuggets and tea i went up to the counter placed my receipt on the counter gently faced away from me and said i am sorry i  before i finished my sentence the employee slammed her hand on my receipt on the counter and dragged it towards her um wtfi did not know how to react because she looked at my receipt and threw it away without addressing me i went umok and backed away from the counter to fill my tea i have no clue what i did to piss this employee off but my friend who came with me asked me what the heck happened i said i have no clue i am just missing my fries my friend was nice and itchy enough to go up to the counter grab the attention of a different employee and told him we were missing our friesbut honestly what is wrong with you i am sorry you were having a bad day but that does not excuse you from taking it out on a customer who was trying to be nice about an honest mistake that can be easily fixed not a big deal i paid for fries and i have an incomplete order so chill geezencounter 23 friends and i came here for smoothies one of my friends ordered a big mac nuggets and fries everyone else got our orders my friend waited 20 minutes for his order to be done no lie we looked at the time on the receiptyoure thinking um yea maybe they were cooking it noin that 20 minutes we saw 5 employees goofing off bickering with each other throwing towels at each other and basically being extremely unprofessional they did not even do this in the back were customers cant see they did this all in front of us just on the other side of the counter based on the managers asking where the order is they seem to have forgotten about the orderi do not care if you do this at work but can you do this when no one is waiting for their food it is really awkward to be standing and waiting while watching you goof off and have your manager ask the team where our order is three timesi really felt embarrassed for the manager because this just reflects badly on him but he really should be more assertive and keep his team in check for his credit he did give us a coupon for a free dessert of our choicewhich honestly is nothing because i dont ever order a pie cone or sundaeoh and our smoothies were not filled all the way to the top mine was 75 full, i ordered 10piece chicken nuggets fries fries and unsweetened ice tea . i paid for fries and i have an incomplete order so chill geezencounter . 23 friends and i came here for smoothies one of my friends ordered

ok ok ok i know it is only a mcdonalds but this one is completely different in decor it is big clean bright and pretty with tons of flat screens all over the place another big plus to this mcdonalds is that they have got free wifi while most hotels charge ridiculous fees so if and when you have your laptop you can deal with business while munching on some frieseven though it is smack dab on the strip there is plenty of parking too, Free wifi while most hotels charge ridiculous fees so if and when you have your laptop you can deal with business while munching on some fries .

the drive thru got our order wrong again i called the manager who argued with me about what was ordered i had to ask her if she cared or was even going to help me she just continued to argue that the drive thru entered what was ordered yelling at me and interrupting me as i told her repeatedly they took the order wrong and this is not the first time this has happened after asking if she was going to be of help she refused saying to call back tomorrow to talk to someone else and hung up on me just because an employee here does not have to be an intelligent person does not mean they can be rude i am sure she is smarter than a dog and even dogs know how to be polite, The drive thru got our order wrong again and i called the manager who argued with me about what was ordered .

when i am really craving for mcdonalds this seems to be the closest but i am no big fan of fast food chainsi do not like this location just because there are bums inside waiting for the bus to go to atlantic city or whateverthey usually sit and chat and drink some coffee same food as any other mcdonalds  waitresses are friendly, When i am craving for mcdonalds this seems to be the closest but i am no big fan of fast food chainsi do not like this location just because there are bums inside waiting for the bus to go to atlantic
two points right out of the gate 1 thuggery knows no race lily white frat boys from the suburbs can be just as vulgar and aggressive as any group with a gang mentality 2 rating a mcdonalds and mcdonalds food is not really an essential service people generally know what they are getting  menu and quality wise  going in the purpose of this review is mostly about the safety factor people need to know and i think locals already do that depending on the time of day night this place is marginally dangerous over my last three visits to chicago i have noticed this neighborhood being overrun by flash mobs who do more looting aggressive panhandling and fighting than choreographed performing in fact this particular mcdonalds had to be closed down for several hours a couple months ago while police attempted to restore order the water tower place mall about a block away has seen an increase in gang activity lately including the arrest of some armed teenagers this is not just my take check out some of the other reviews of this place and this neighborhood many are pointing out that the mag mile is slowly becoming the mug mile and this mcdonalds seems to be ground zero for hip hop nation as they pour off the red line after taking up two seats on the subway while grandma has to stand apologists and the agenda driven will say and have said these kids are guilty of nothing other than being black in a predominantly white neighborhood really since when does being authentically black include screaming nonstop obscenities with little kids around black and white since when did chicago get so soft on youth crime since when did it become open season on civility since when did my reviews start reading like the rantings of some terrified reactionaryfascist while it is mildly funny that katelyn emily ashley and their dolly buying mommies must sometimes contend with this thuggery after they leave the american girl doll store nobody not even the overprivileged country club set should have to endure this genuinely menacing behavior and youth thugs of any race should not be permitted to turn this area into the wild midwest just a thought rahm  do what you want with it, This particular mcdonalds had to be closed down for several hours a couple months ago while police attempted to restore order . The neighborhood is overrun by flash mobs who do more looting aggressive panhandling and fighting than choreographed performing .
i wanted to grab breakfast one morning before work since it is just across the street but the restaurant was filled with homeless people it is like their hangout spot i waited a lot longer than i needed to just to order if they did not have bums loitering around maybe would have added one more star the staff is not the problem they look like they actually have to deal with a lot if problematic people they should focus on making the place a little pleasant for their guest no one wants to eat their burger while having to endure the smell if urine lingering off a homeless person, i wanted to grab breakfast one morning before work since it is just across the street but the restaurant was filled with homeless people it is like their hangout spot .
